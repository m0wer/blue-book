# Coffee Tools

## Coffee Grinder

[PORLEX Mini Grinder II – Porlex Grinders](https://www.porlexgrinders.com/products/porlex-mini-grinder-ii)
bought for ~70 €. It has a ceramic burr and small size. Grinding 14 grams of
coffee takes about 1 minute. It is not very fast.

I get good results, but it isn't the best grinder, specially for espresso. I
use 3 or 4 clicks for espresso. It would be cool to have more precision. But
nothing that can't be worked around by changing the dose.

If you are looking for a grinder, I would recommend to get the
“TIMEMORE Chestnut C2" instead. Costs about the same or even less, has a metal
burr and very good reviews.

Electric coffee grinders of the same quality are much more expensive.

## Espresso Machine

I have the De'Longhi Dedica EC685. It is a very “cheap” espresso machine
(~170€). It has a pressurized portafilter, which sucks. First upgrade would be
to get a non-pressurized bottomless portafilter (~15 € in Aliexpress).

Change the machine temperature setting to the maximum. And switch it to
steaming mode before pulling a shot. This will make the machine heat up to the
maximum temperature. Then you'll have to restart it since otherwise it won't
allow you to pull a espresso shot until it cools down, which we don't want.

You can choose the extraction time by holding down the button. I usually go
for 25 seconds.


## Coffee beans

I buy coffee beans from [Incapto](https://incapto.com/). They are from
Barcelona and roast the beans themselves. When bought through Amazon you
usually get beans roasted 2-4 weeks ago. I haven't tried them all yet. I love
the aroma of the Colombian ones, better without milk. And the Peruvian ones
are amazing with milk.

## Others

Apart from the grinder and the espresso machine, you'll need a tamper, a
scale, a milk jug, a thermometer, a timer (your phone works), a WDT tool,
a knock box, and a filter screen.
