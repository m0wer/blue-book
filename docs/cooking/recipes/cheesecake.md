# Summary

* 30 minutes preparation and 30 minutes cooking.
* Requires an oven.

# Ingredients

For 8 portions.

For the cake mix:

* 3 eggs.
* 180 g of sugar.
* 400 g of cream cheese.
* 200 mL of cream.
* A tablespoon of wheat or corn flour.
* A bit of sweetened condensed milk.
* A bit of vanilla extract or pods.
* A pinch of salt.

For the cookie layer:

* 200 g of cookies.
* 50 g of butter.

# Preparation

1. Preheat the oven at 200 ยบ C with the fan on.
1. Smash the cookies and mix them with the melted butter.
1. Cover a baking tin with baking foil.
1. Spread and press the cookies and butter mix on the bottom of the tin.
1. Mix the rest of the ingredients and put them on top of the cookie layer.
1. Bake for 20-30 minutes, as desired.

# Tips

* Wet the baking paper with water so the cake doesn't stick to it.
* Pay close attention to the last minutes of the baking process to take it out
  whenever it reaches your cooking point preference. It gets "solid" pretty
  fast.
* The cookie layer has a better texture and bite when cold.
