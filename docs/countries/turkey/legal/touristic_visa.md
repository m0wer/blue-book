To be able to reside in Turkey after the regular 90 day visa expires, you need
a short-term residence permit. You can get it with a [work permit](work) or
with some short-term visas, such as the touristic visa.

This short-term visa will be given for a year at most.

Note that you are not allowed to work with the touristic visa.

# Residence permit steps

This is the procedure to obtain a residence permit through a touristic visa
from Turkey (not from abroad). Since a rental contract and other documents are
required, it might be hard to arrange everything from abroad, but it's still
possible.

It is assumed that you are already in Turkey because you entered with the 90
day touristic visa.

1. Get 4 biometric photos.
1. Get a health insurance. You'll need the original stamped/sealed insurance
  policy. A minimum-coverage local health insurance policy will cost around
  600 TL for a year.
1. Fill the form for the immigration services appointment        a
  [Directorate General of Migration Management](https://e-ikamet.goc.gov.tr/).
  Notes:
    * Official required
      [documents list](https://e-ikamet.goc.gov.tr/Ikamet/BasvuruIstenenBelgeler/BasvuruFormuIstenenBelgeler?tur=0).
    * If the income is your savings, it's recommended to divide your saving
      by the number of months you are staying and fill the result as your
      monthly income, instead of puting just 0.

1. Get a photocopy of your passport including the personal information page and
  the page where the passport control stamp is.
1. Get a statement on having sufficient financial means through the stay. Might
  not be requested. Could be bank statement of a long enough period. You can
  open an account in a Turkish bank, for that you will need to get your tax
  number (vergi numarasÄ±) from the local tax office.
1. Get a notarized copy of your rental agreement.

Wait for the appointment. A short interview will take place. If everything goes
well, they will tell you to pay the residence permit fees (card and single
entry fee) which add up to around 568 TL. Then you have to pay them and come
back. The residence permit card will be delivered to your address of stay.
