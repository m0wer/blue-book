To be able to reside in Turkey after the regular 90 day visa expires, you need
a short-term residence permit. You can get it with a [work permit](work) or
with some short-term visas, such as the touristic visa.

This short-term visa will be given for a year at most.

Note that you are not allowed to work with the touristic visa.

# Residence permit steps

This is the procedure to obtain a residence permit through a touristic visa
from Turkey (not from abroad). Since a rental contract and other documents are
required, it might be hard to arrange everything from abroad, but it's still
possible.

It is assumed that you are already in Turkey because you entered with the 90
day touristic visa.

1. Get 4 biometric photos.
1. Get a health insurance. You'll need the original stamped/sealed insurance
  policy. A minimum-coverage local health insurance policy will cost around
  600 TL for a year.
1. Fill the form for the immigration services appointment        a
  [Directorate General of Migration Management](https://e-ikamet.goc.gov.tr/).
  Notes:
    * Official required
      [documents list](https://e-ikamet.goc.gov.tr/Ikamet/BasvuruIstenenBelgeler/BasvuruFormuIstenenBelgeler?tur=0).
    * If the income is your savings, it's recommended to divide your saving
      by the number of months you are staying and fill the result as your
      monthly income, instead of puting just 0.

      filling process.
1. Get a photocopy of your passport including the personal information page and
  the page where the passport control stamp is.
1. Get a statement on having sufficient financial means through the stay. Might
  not be requested. Could be bank statement of a long enough period. You can
  open an account in a Turkish bank, for that you will need to get your tax
  number (vergi numarası) from the local tax office.
1. Get a notarized copy of your rental agreement.

Wait for the appointment. A short interview will take place. If everything goes
well, they will tell you to pay the residence permit fees (card and single
entry fee) which add up to around 568 TL. Then you have to pay them and come
back. The residence permit card will be delivered to your address of stay.

# Experience

I applied for the residence permit for touristic purposes for a year. I am a
European citizen and this was my first application. I entered Turkey
with my passport (visa exemption) on the 10/07/2021.

## Process

1. 14/07/2021: Submitted the online form (https://e-ikamet.goc.gov.tr/).
  For which I needed a house rent contract (they don't ask for it directly but
  they ask for the house address), a Turkish phone number, a portrait picture
  and a health insurance policy.
1. 16/07/2021: I received an email informing me of the interview appointment date
  (05/08/2021 at 13:00).
1. 05/08/2021: I went to the Ankara Valiliği il Göç İdaresi Müdürlüğü
  (Barbaros, Binnaz Sk. No:2, 06680 Çankaya/Ankara) and arrived there at 12:30
  (half an hour early). I waited in line and told the security guy that I was
  early and asked if I could go in anyways. The security guy answered
  laughing that we all had the appointment at the same time (hundreds of
  people) so it was ok to go early. He then asked for my pink classifier
  (pembe dosya) which I had never heard of. Apparently you need to bring your
  documents in one of those but that rule is not written anywhere. I went down
  the street and bought one for 3 TL and came back, they let me in without
  having to wait in the line again.
1. In the reception, some workers where checking the passports and the
  documents and giving some stickers with a line number. Then, we went to a
  waiting room where there was a screen calling line numbers. At first you
  shouldn't wait for your number to be called but instead fill the papers with
  your phone number and name which are on a table in the back. Then, you
  should go to the cash desk (vezne) and pay the taxes stated in the printout
  of the online form. The cash desk opens at one and there is no order to pay.
  You can only pay with cash.
  After this, I left that room and went upstairs where I waited for an hour
  to be called. I waited for my turn for the interview, where I was asked
  for the basic documents and had no questioning or anything like that and
  took around 2 minutes. I had to give the notarized copy of my rental
  contract, the signed form printout, 4 biometric pictures, a photocopy of
  my passport main page and of the page where the entry stamp was and the
  health insurance signed policy documents. They didn't ask for the bank
  statement or anything else.
  The whole process took 2 hours. It was really messy and people did not
  generally respect the line order, but the workers were generally friendly
  and nice.
1.  24/08/2021: I check for the status of my application online
   (https://e-ikamet.goc.gov.tr/) and saw that there were missing documents
  (didn't specify which). So I went that same day to the Göç İdaresi. A worker
  checked the status on the computer and told me that I had to pay for the
  single entry visa fee. I did it and then went upstairs to the missing
  document issues room, where some workers looked for my folder and added the
  tax receipt.
1. 03/09/2021: I checked the status of my application and it said that it had
  been concluded positively.
1. 04/09/2021: I received the residence permit card at my house from PTT.

I didn't get any notifications via SMS at all so its important to constantly
check online for the status.

I asked for the residence permit to be from 01/08/2021 to the 01/08/2022
(same as the insurance) but I got it 14/07/2021 to the 09/07/2022.

## Costs

* Biometric pictures: 35 TL.
* One year basic health insurance (SOMPO SIGORTA): 85 TL.
* Notarized copy of the rent contract: 125 TL.
* Pink classifier: 3 TL.
* Card and residence permit taxes: 462 TL.
* Single entry visa: 759 TL.

**TOTAL**: 1,469 TL

I'm not including the Sim card costs (600TL for 3 months with internet)
and the photocopy prices (few TL).

After obtaining the residence permit I had to notify my Turkish
cell phone operator.
