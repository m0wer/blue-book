Eskişehir is a city in northwestern Turkey and the capital of the
Eskişehir Province. In the Byzantine era its name was Dorylaeum. The city is
located on the banks of the Porsuk River, 792 m above sea level, where it
overlooks the fertile Phrygian Valley. In the nearby hills one can find hot
springs. The city is 233 km to the west of Ankara and 330 km to the southeast
of Istanbul.

The city is known for being a cheap student city and small enough to be able
to go anywhere by walking (which is generally true but with few exceptions).

It's easy (and cheap) to go to Eskişehir from Ankara or Istanbul with the
high-speed train (YHT).
