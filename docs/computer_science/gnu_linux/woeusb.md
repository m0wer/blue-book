[WoeUSB/WoeUSB](https://github.com/WoeUSB/WoeUSB) is a Microsoft WindowsÂ® USB
installation media preparer for GNU+Linux.

Unlike other operating systems, winbugs ISOs can't be directly flashed, so a
special process has to be done for creating a bootable winbugs USB.

This tool will create a bootable winbugs installer USB. If you want to create
a Window To Go portable USB instead, check [WinToUsb](wintousb).

# Usage

1. Download the latest WoeUSB bash script from the releases page.
1. Download a winbugs ISO from
  [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10ISO).
1. Execute

  ```bash
  sudo {path to woeusb.bash} -v --target-filesystem NTFS --device {path to ISO} {path to USB device}
  ```

  Don't add the USB partition number to the device. For example use `/dev/sdb/`
  instead of `/dev/sdb1`.

  The you'll be ready to go. Fuck winbugs.
