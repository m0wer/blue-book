[Hushboard](https://kryogenix.org/code/hushboard/) is an utility that mutes your microphone while youâ€™re typing.

# Installation

They recommend using the [Snap Store package](https://snapcraft.io/hushboard)
but you can also install it manually as follows:

```bash
sudo apt install libgirepository1.0-dev libcairo2-dev
mkvirtualenv hushboard
git clone https://github.com/stuartlangridge/hushboard
cd hushboard
pip install pycairo PyGObject six xlib
pip install .
deactivate
```

# Running the application

You can run it manually as follows

```bash
workon hushboard
python -m hushboard
deactivate
```

Or if you use [i3wm](i3wm), add

```
exec --no-startup-id workon hushboard && python -m hushboard
```

to your `i3wm` configuration file to start it automatically.

# Notes

`mkvirtualenv`, `deactivate` and `workon` are part of [`virtualenvwrapper`](virtualenvwrapper).
