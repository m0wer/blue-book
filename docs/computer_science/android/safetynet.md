[SafetyNet](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet) is a mechanism
now included by default in Android that detects device tampering, bad URLs,
potentially harmful apps, and fake users and reports it to other apps.

In practice this means that if you have root access to your device you won't be
able to install apps such as banking apps and apps that show DRM protected
content.

There are ways of hiding root access to SafetyNet but this solutions don't last
for long, because SafetyNet is updated to detect this kind of “cheats”. Fuck
  googel.
