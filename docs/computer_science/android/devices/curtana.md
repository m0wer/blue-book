The codename is `curtana` but its also name of a larger family named `miatoll`.

# Recoveries

For Android 11 use [PitchBlack Recovery Project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pbrp/files/miatoll/).

# ROMs

I use [Pixel Extended-ROM](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pixelextended/files/Miatoll/).
It's nice and passes [SafetyNet](safetynet) if unrooted.
