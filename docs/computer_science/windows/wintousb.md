[WinToUSB](https://www.easyuefi.com/wintousb/) is a Windows To Go (WTG) creator.
It is not open source, it has a free (of charge) version. It is distributed as
a Windows executable.

As of now, I couldn't find any open source alternatives to it.

# Usage

1. Download [WinToUSB](https://www.easyuefi.com/wintousb/downloads/WinToUSB_Free.exe).
1. Install it.
1. Download the [W10 ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10).
1. Run it and follow the steps.

I generally choose the GPT+UEFI installation option. The installation will take
a long time (maybe more than an hour).

Fuck winbugs.
