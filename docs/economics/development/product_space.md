This entry is a summary of a [paper](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/317/5837/482)
that studies the economic development of countries using network science analysis [@hidalgo2007product].

# Abstract

> Economies grow by upgrading the products they produce and export.
  The technology, capital, institutions, and skills needed to make newer
  products are more easily adapted from some products than from others. Here,
  we study this network of relatedness between products, or “product space,”
  finding that more-sophisticated products are located in a densely connected
  core whereas less-sophisticated products occupy a less-connected periphery.
  Empirically, countries move through the product space by developing goods
  close to those they currently produce. Most countries can reach the core
  only by traversing empirically infrequent distances, which may help explain
  why poor countries have trouble developing more competitive exports and fail
  to converge to the income levels of rich countries.

# Summary

Economic power is usually measured with the aggregate output of a countries
capital and labor. The main idea of the article is that diversity of a countries
exports matters, and it's useful when predicting a countries development.

Countries are more likely to produce products which have similar requirements
as the ones they already produce.

This video is a great introduction (and even summary) of what's developed in
the paper.
