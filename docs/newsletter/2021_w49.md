### [Github Actions](github_actions.md)

* New: Concurrency.

    You can use `concurrency` to cancel any in-progress job or run. Example:
    
    ```yaml
    concurrency:
      group: docs-${{ github.head_ref }}
      cancel-in-progress: true
    ```
    
    This is useful to cancel previous jobs if new commits are pushed, which saves
    minutes, energy and avoids conflicts when pushing changes during the action.
    

## Programming

### [Basics](basics.md)

* New: Add Flutter basics about maps.
* New: Writing Flutter documentation.
* New: Combine/merge/concat maps.

    You can use spread operator `...`:
    
    ```dart
    final firstMap = {"1":"2"};
    final secondMap = {"2":"3"};
    
    final thirdMap = {
       ...firstMap,
       ...secondMap,
    };
    ```
    

* New: Find element from list.

    Use `.firstWhere()`:
    
    ```dart
    List<Currency> currencies = ...;
    Currency dollar = currencies.firstWhere((currency) => currency.code == "USD");
    ```
    

* New: .? operator.

    Use `?.` when you want to call a method/getter on an object if that object is
    not null (otherwise, return null).
    
    Example:
    
    ```dart
    currentState?.open();
    ```
    

### [Debugging](debugging.md)

* New: Debugging Flutter.

    Import `dart:developer` and add `debugger();` wherever you want.
    Then, open your browsers developer tools and use the console.
    

### [pytest](pytest.md)

* New: Class fixture.

    To run a custom function for every test in a class do:
    
    ```python
    class TestClass:
        @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
        def setup(self):
            self.variable = 42
    
        def test_something(self):
            ...
    ```
    

# Other

* New: Catch only some kind of errors.

    Use `@retry(retry=retry_if_exception_type(IOError))`.
    
    Several types of exceptions can be combined as follows:
    
    ```python
    @retry(retry=(retry_if_exception_type(IOError) | retry_if_exception_type(TimeoutError)))
    ```
    

* New: Parse hexadecimal color string.

    ```dart
    /// Construct a color from a hex code string, of the format #RRGGBB.
    Color hexToColor(String code) {
      return new Color(int.parse(code.substring(1, 7), radix: 16) + 0xFF000000);
    }
    ```
