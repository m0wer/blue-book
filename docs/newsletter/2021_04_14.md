## Programming

### [Python](jupyter.md)

* New: Jupyter Notebook/Lab.

    [Jupyter Notebook/Lab](https://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application
    that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code,
    equations, visualizations and narrative text. It can be used for R and for
    Python, among others.


* New: [Jupyter Server Proxy.](jupyter.md#extensions)

    [Jupyter Server Proxy](https://jupyter-server-proxy.readthedocs.io/) lets you
    run arbitrary external processes (such as RStudio, Shiny Server, syncthing,
    PostgreSQL, etc) alongside your notebook, and provide authenticated web access
    to them.


* New: [Jupyter-dash.](jupyter.md#libraries)

    [plotly/jupyter-dash](https://github.com/plotly/jupyter-dash) is a library
    that makes it easy to develop Plotly Dash apps interactively from within
    Jupyter environments.


### [Typing](typing.md)

* New: Python type hints.

    Since Python 3.5, type hints are supported. Note that the Python runtime does
    not enforce function and variable type annotations but they can be used by
    third party tools such as type checkers, IDEs, linters, etc.


* New: [Python type aliases.](typing.md#usage)

    A type alias is defined by assigning the type to the alias.
