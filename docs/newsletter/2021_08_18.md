## Programming

### [Docstrings](docstrings.md)

* New: Python docstrings.

    A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module,
    function, class, or method definition. Such a docstring becomes the `__doc__`
    special attribute of that object. See
    [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)

* New: Breakpoint().

     Since Python 3.7, we can just call `breakpoint()` and this will import
     [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html)
     (or the debugger defined in the environment variable `PYTHONBREAKPOINT`) and
     set the breakpoint in that part of the code. This will stop the program
     execution once the breakpoint is reached. Then, an interactive console while
     appear.
