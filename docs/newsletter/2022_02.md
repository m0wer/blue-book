## Programming

### [Jinja](jinja.md)

* New: Accessing the parent Loop.

    The special loop variable always points to the innermost loop. If it’s desired
    to have access to an outer loop it’s possible to alias it:

    ```jinja
    <table>
    {% for row in table %}
      <tr>
      {% set rowloop = loop %}
      {% for cell in row %}
        <td id="cell-{{ rowloop.index }}-{{ loop.index }}">{{ cell }}</td>
      {% endfor %}
      </tr>
    {% endfor %}
    </table>
    ```


### [NGINX](flutter_nginx.md)

* New: Support named routes.

    To support named routes (e.g., `APP_HOST/some/route`), add the following
    configuration to the host configuration file:

    ```nginx
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
    ```

    Otherwise NGINX will return 404 when queried for a named route since the
    corresponding file won't exist in the root directory.


### [pip](pip.md)

* New: Uninstall all packages.

    ```bash
    pip freeze | xargs pip uninstall -y
    ```

    private businesses suffer under increasingly burdensome laws and regulations.

    and a movie divided in three parts.


### [The Problem of Political Authority](the_problem_of_political_authority.md)

* New: The Problem of Political Authority.

    Modern states commonly deploy coercion in a wide array of circumstances in
    which the resort to force would clearly be wrong for any private agent. What
    entitles the state to behave in this manner? And why should citizens obey its
    commands? This book examines theories of political authority, from the social
    contract theory, to theories of democratic authorization, to fairness- and
    consequence-based theories. Ultimately, no theory of authority succeeds, and
    thus no government has the kind of authority often ascribed to governments.

    The author goes on to discuss how voluntary and competitive institutions could
    provide the central goods for the sake of which the state is often deemed
    necessary, including law, protection from private criminals, and national
    security. An orderly and livable society thus does not require acquiescence in
    the illusion of political authority.
