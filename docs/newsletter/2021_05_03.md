### [NetworkX](networkx.md)

* New: NetworkX graph from digraph.

    Use `networkx.DiGraph.to_undirected(reciprocal=False, as_view=False)`.
    

* New: NetworkX subgraph filtering.

    To get a subgraph of another by filtering nodes and or edges, use
    `networkx.classes.graphviews.subgraph_view(G, filter_node=<function no_filter>, filter_edge=<function no_filter>)`.
