## GNULinux

### [Basics](gnu_linux_basics.md)

* New: Get the cursor position.

    Useful for recording part of the screen with (`ffmpeg`)[ffmpeg].
    
    ```bash
    watch -n 0.1 xdotool getmouselocation
    ```
    

### [Git](git.md)

* New: Merge conflict style.

    Take the pain out of git conflict resolution: use diff3
    
    ```bash
    git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3
    ```
    
    After running this command to turn on diff3, each new conflict will have a 3rd
    section, the merged common ancestor.
    
    ```gitconflict
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    GreenMessage.send(include_signature: true)
    ||||||| merged common ancestor
    BlueMessage.send(include_signature: true)
    =======
    BlueMessage.send(include_signature: false)
    >>>>>>> merged-branch
    ```
    

* New: View file evolution.

    You can use `git log -L` to view the evolution of a range of lines. Example:
    
    ```bash
    git log -L 15,23:filename.txt
    ```
    
    means *trace the evolution of lines `15` to `23` in the file named
    `filename.txt`*.
    

* New: Compare file accross references.

    To compare a file accross references (branches, tags, commits...) do:
    
    ```bash
    git diff <reference1> <reference2> -- <file>
    ```
    

### [grep](grep.md)

* New: Common options.

    * `-r`: recursively search a directory.
    * `-i`: ignore case.
    * `-l`: print only the path of the files that have at least one match.
    

* New: Limit results line length.

    First 400 bytes of the line:
    
    ```bash
    grep "foobar" * | cut -b 1-400
    ```
    
    This might leave the match out, but it's simple to use and enough for most
    cases. The other option is:
    
    ```bash
    grep -rEo ".{0,10}wantedText.{0,10}" *
    ```
    

### [neovim](neovim.md)

* New: Marks.

    A mark allows you to record your current position so you can return to it
    later.
    
    Usage:
    
    * `:marks`: show existing marks.
    * `ma`: set mark `a` in current position of current file, accessible only from
      the current file.
    * `mA`: set mark `A` in current position of current file, accessible from
      anywhere.
    * `'a`: Go to mark `a`.
    * `]'`: jump to next line with a lowercase mark.
    

* New: Sed replace with newline.
* New: Without RegEx.

    Use `:sno` instead of `:s` to disable magic.
