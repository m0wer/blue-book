## Programming

### [unittest](unittest.md)

* New: Python unittest and unittest.mock.

    The [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) unit
    testing framework was originally inspired by JUnit and has a similar flavor as
    major unit testing frameworks in other languages. It supports test automation,
    sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into
    collections, and independence of the tests from the reporting framework.
    
    [`unittest.mock`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html) is a
    library for testing in Python. It allows you to replace parts of your system
    under test with mock objects and make assertions about how they have been used.
