* New: Add placeins package.

    Use it to ensure figures appear before certain point.
    

* New: Altgr-intl layout.

    My favorite layout is [altgr-intl](https://altgr-weur.eu/altgr-intl.html)
    because it is based on the standard US layout, which is comfortable for
    programming and allows me to write accents on letters (required for Spanish
    and French). And by adding some modifications it can be used for Turkish too.

### [Gerunds](gerunds.md)

    They are used to avoid repetition of the verb tense in sentences with several verbs.
