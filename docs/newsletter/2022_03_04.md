### [demicode](demicode.md)

* New: Get BIOS version.

    ```bash
    dmidecode -t bios -q
    ```
    

### [neovim](neovim.md)

* New: Vim-surround shortcuts.

    * `ysiw"`: Surround the word under the cursor with double quotes.
    * `csiw"'`: Change the quotes surrounding the word under the cursor from double
      quotes to single quotes.
    * `ds'`: Delete the single quotes surrounding the word under the cursor.
    * `ysi)"`: Surround the text inside parentheses with double quotes.
    * `cs)]`: Change the parentheses surrounding the text inside parentheses to
      square brackets.
    

### [PostgreSQL](postgresql.md)

* New: Get the 20 slowest queries.

    ```psql
    SELECT substring(query, 1, 50) AS short_query,
                  round(total_time::numeric, 2) AS total_time,
                  calls,
                  round(mean_time::numeric, 2) AS mean,
                  round((100 * total_time / sum(total_time::numeric) OVER ())::numeric, 2) AS percentage_cpu
    FROM  pg_stat_statements
    ORDER BY total_time DESC
    LIMIT 20;
    ```
    

* New: Count NULL values.

    ```psql
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table WHERE column IS NULL;
    ```
    `COUNT` only conseiders non null values so use `COUNT(*)` (which counts the
    row) instead of `COUNT(column)` because the later would always return 0 since
    the filter gets only the null values of `column`.
