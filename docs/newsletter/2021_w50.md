* New: Testing startup and shutdown events.

    When you need your event handlers (`startup` and `shutdown`) to run in your
    tests, you can use the `TestClient` with a with statement:
    
    ```python
    import pytest
    from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
    from api.main import api
    
    @pytest.fixture
    def client():
        with TestClient(api) as client:
            yield client
    
    def test_endpoint(client):
        response = client.get("/endpoint")
    
        assert response.status_code == 200
    ```

* New: Find duplicated lines.

    Also counts how many times they appear.
    
    ```bash
    sort <file> | uniq -c
    ```
