* New: Sticky touchpad after suspend.

    After suspension, the touchpad behaves weird: can't scroll, and acts as if you
    were clicking and dragging (sticky). The TrackPoint works correctly though.
    
    A first solution was to disable it and just use the TrackPoint. This is done
    as follows:
    
    ```bash
    xinput list # look for SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad
    xinput set-prop <number> "Device Enabled" 0
    ```
    
    This allows you to use the computer without the sticky mouse annoyance but
    doesn't actually solve the problem. For that, the solution that worked for me
    is removing the `psmouse` kernel module before suspending and then reloading it
    after waking up from suspension. You can first try to do this manualy and then
    if it works create this script in `/lib/systemd/system-sleep/psmouse`:
    
    ```bash
    
    case $1/$2 in
      pre/*)
        echo "Going to $2..."
        modprobe -r psmouse
        ;;
      post/*)
        echo "Waking up from $2..."
        sleep 2
        modprobe psmouse
        ;;
    esac
    ```
