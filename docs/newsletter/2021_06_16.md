* New: Extract a page range of a PDF.

    To extract a page range of a PDF you could print to file using `evince`
    selecting a page range. The drawback of this method is that the text might be
    converted to images an thus no longer be searchable. A faster alternative that
    also keeps the text intact is using `pdftk`.
