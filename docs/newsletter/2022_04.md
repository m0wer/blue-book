### [Adjust external monitor brightness](script_adjust_external_monitors_brightness.md)

* New: Script to adjust external monitor brightness.

    If you want to adjust the external monitor brightness according to the main
    display, you can run the following script after every brightness change to the
    main monitor.
    
    ```bash
    
    xrandr -q | grep -q "DisplayPort-4 connected" || exit 0
    
    (
      # Wait for lock on /var/lock/adjust_external_monitors_brightness.exclusivelock (fd 200) for 20 seconds
      flock -x -w 20 200 || exit 1
    
      # main screen brightness (from 0 to 255)
      main=$(cat /sys/class/backlight/amdgpu_bl0/brightness)
    
      # external monitor
      l27_max=100 # max brightness
      l27_0=40 # equivalent brightness of main for l27 min brightness
      l27_100=255 # equivalent brightness of main for l27 max brightness
    
      # equivalent brightness for the external monitor
      l27=$(( 100 * ( (main > l27_0 ? main : l27_0) - l27_0 ) / (l27_100 - l27_0) ))
    
      # try to set it until success
      until ddccontrol -r 0x10 -w $l27 dev:/dev/i2c-11 | grep -q "Writing 0x10";
      do
        sleep 1;
      done
    
    ) 200>/var/lock/adjust_external_monitors_brightness.exclusivelock
    ```
    
    You will need to make a few adjustments:
    
    * Change `DisplayPort-4` to whatever corresponds to your external monitor.
    * Change `/sys/class/backlight/amdgpu_bl0/brightness` if you use Intel.
    * Adjust the variables (`l27_max`, `l27_0`, `l27_100`).
    * Get the corresponding i2c device (change `i2c-11`) by running `ddccontrol -p`.
    

### [Alacritty](alacritty.md)

* New: Setup remote shell automatically.

    An useful`zsh` function is:
    
    ```zshrc
    s () {
        infocmp | ssh $@ 'tic -x /dev/stdin'
        ssh $@
    }
    ```
    
    Which will setup the shell always before connecting.
    

### [Bash](bash.md)

* New: Get min or max from two variables.

    Use the ternary operator. For example, for `MAX(10, $VAR)` do:
    
    ```bash
    $((VAR > 10 ? VAR : 10))
    ```
    

* New: Run a command until the ouptut contains some text.

    ```bash
    until somecommand | grep -q "Up to date";
    do
      sleep 1;
    done
    ```
    

* New: Flcok.

    To ensure only one instance of the script runs some code, you can use `flock`
    as follows:
    
    ```bash
    (
      # Wait for lock on /var/lock/.myscript.exclusivelock (fd 200) for 10 seconds
      flock -x -w 10 200 || exit 1
    
      # Do stuff
    
    ) 200>/var/lock/.myscript.exclusivelock
    ```
    

* New: Beep alert.

    You can generate a beep alert (if enabled in the system) and a window highlight
    with:
    
    ```bash
    echo -e "\a"
    ```
    

### [Basics](gnu_linux_basics.md)

* New: Get command output or default value if emtpy.

    ```bash
    echo | sed 's/^$/default value/'
    ```
    

* New: Get the cursor position.

    Useful for recording part of the screen with (`ffmpeg`)[ffmpeg].
    
    ```bash
    watch -n 0.1 xdotool getmouselocation
    ```
    

### [dpkg](dpkg.md)

* New: Most common commands.

    * `dpkg -S` (--search): Find package(s) owning file(s).
    

### [Git](git.md)

* New: Push tags.

    To push the local tags to the remote server:
    
    ```bash
    git push --tags
    ```
    

* New: Move last n commits to a new branch.

    So you forgot to create a feature branch ah? No problem, let's move the last
    few unpushed commits to a new branch:
    
    ```bash
    git checkout -b new_branch # create a new branch from the current one
    git checkout old_branch # go back to the original branch
    git reset --hard HEAD~3 # undo the last 3 commits
    git checkout new_branch # go to the new branch and continue there
    ```
    

* New: Modify specific commit message.

    ```bash
    git rebase --interactive '<commit-id>^'
    ```
    
    Then replace `pick` with `r` and save to modify the commit message.
    

* New: Merge conflict style.

    Take the pain out of git conflict resolution: use diff3
    
    ```bash
    git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3
    ```
    
    After running this command to turn on diff3, each new conflict will have a 3rd
    section, the merged common ancestor.
    
    ```gitconflict
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    GreenMessage.send(include_signature: true)
    ||||||| merged common ancestor
    BlueMessage.send(include_signature: true)
    =======
    BlueMessage.send(include_signature: false)
    >>>>>>> merged-branch
    ```
    

* New: View file evolution.

    You can use `git log -L` to view the evolution of a range of lines. Example:
    
    ```bash
    git log -L 15,23:filename.txt
    ```
    
    means *trace the evolution of lines `15` to `23` in the file named
    `filename.txt`*.
    

* New: Compare file accross references.

    To compare a file accross references (branches, tags, commits...) do:
    
    ```bash
    git diff <reference1> <reference2> -- <file>
    ```
    

* New: Revert file to specific commit.

    ```bash
    git checkout c5f567 -- file1/to/restore file2/to/restore
    ```
    

### [GPG](gpg.md)

* New: Generate a key.

    Use `gpg --gen-key` or `gpg --full-gen-key` for more options.
    

* New: Export public key.

    gpg --output public.pgp --armor --export username@email
    ```
    

### [grep](grep.md)

* New: Common options.

    * `-r`: recursively search a directory.
    * `-i`: ignore case.
    * `-l`: print only the path of the files that have at least one match.
    

* New: Limit results line length.

    First 400 bytes of the line:
    
    ```bash
    grep "foobar" * | cut -b 1-400
    ```
    
    This might leave the match out, but it's simple to use and enough for most
    cases. The other option is:
    
    ```bash
    grep -rEo ".{0,10}wantedText.{0,10}" *
    ```
    

### [GTK](gtk.md)

* New: How to change themes.

    GTK is a free and open-source cross-platform widget toolkit for creating
    graphical user interfaces.
    
    To change the theme, either use `lxapparence` or manually edit
    `~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini`.
    You will be forced to do the second option if the theme is for gtk-3 only.

### [i3 window manager](i3wm.md)

* New: Get pressed key name.

    Some key names are hard to guess, such as `XF86AudioRaiseVolume`, and you need
    their name to use them in bindings. You can use `xev` for that.
    

### [LibreOffice](libreoffice.md)

* New: LibreOffice Calc IF().

    Syntax: `IF(Test, Then Value, Otherwise Value)`.

    interactively.
    

* New: Cherry pick lines to commit.

    [tpope/vim-fugitive: fugitive.vim: A Git wrapper so awesome, it should be illegal](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
    
    1. Open the git summary with :Git (or :G).
    1. Expand the file which contains the lines you want to stage with `>`
      (or `=` to toggle). This will only show the changed chunks plus some extra
      lines of context above and below the changed lines.
    1. `V` to start visual mode and select the lines you want to stage with `hjkl`.
    1. `s` to stage the visual selection (or `-` to toggle)
    1. Repeat 2-4 as needed
    1. `cc` to commit
    

* New: Search for visual selection.

    ```vimrc
    vnoremap // y/\V<C-R>=escape(@",'/\')<CR><CR>
    ```
    To use the mapping, visually select the characters that are wanted in the
    search, then type `//` to search for the next occurrence of the selected text.
    

* New: Marks.

    A mark allows you to record your current position so you can return to it
    later.
    
    Usage:
    
    * `:marks`: show existing marks.
    * `ma`: set mark `a` in current position of current file, accessible only from
      the current file.
    * `mA`: set mark `A` in current position of current file, accessible from
      anywhere.
    * `'a`: Go to mark `a`.
    * `]'`: jump to next line with a lowercase mark.
    

* New: Sed replace with newline.
* New: Without RegEx.

    Use `:sno` instead of `:s` to disable magic.

    ```bash
    ldapsearch [...] +
    ```
    

### [PostgreSQL](postgresql.md)

* New: Stop remote connections.

    Some operations, like dropping a database, require that the database has no connections. To stop all remote connections and prevent them from connecting again, do:
    
    ```psql
    ALTER DATABASE somedatabase ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = OFF;
    
    SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)
    FROM pg_stat_activity
    WHERE datname = 'somedatabase';
    ```
    
    But if you are using PostgreSQL 13 or above, for dropping a table you can directly do:
    
    ```psql
    DROP DATABASE db_name WITH (FORCE);
    ```
    

* New: List databases.

    ```psql
    \l
    ```
    

### [sed](sed.md)

* New: Use matched pattern.

    ```bash
    echo "foobarbaz" | sed 's/^foo\(.*\)baz$/\1/'
