### [grep](grep.md)

* New: Common options.

    * `-r`: recursively search a directory.
    * `-i`: ignore case.
    * `-l`: print only the path of the files that have at least one match.
    

* New: Limit results line length.

    First 400 bytes of the line:
    
    ```bash
    grep "foobar" * | cut -b 1-400
    ```
    
    This might leave the match out, but it's simple to use and enough for most
    cases. The other option is:
    
    ```bash
    grep -rEo ".{0,10}wantedText.{0,10}" *
    ```
    

### [neovim](neovim.md)

* New: Marks.

    A mark allows you to record your current position so you can return to it
    later.
    
    Usage:
    
    * `:marks`: show existing marks.
    * `ma`: set mark `a` in current position of current file, accessible only from
      the current file.
    * `mA`: set mark `A` in current position of current file, accessible from
      anywhere.
    * `'a`: Go to mark `a`.
    * `]'`: jump to next line with a lowercase mark.
