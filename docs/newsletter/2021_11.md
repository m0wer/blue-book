### [Git](git.md)

* New: Git stash.

    If you have uncommitted changes and you want to switch to another branch,
    you can temporarily save those changes with:
    
    ```bash
    git stash
    ```
    
    Then, to reapply them, do:
    
    ```bash
    git stash pop
    ```
    

### [PostgreSQL](postgresql.md)

    ```sql
    ALTER USER user_name WITH PASSWORD 'new_password';
    ```

* New: Limit concurrency.

    Use
    [`asyncio.Semaphore`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-sync.html#semaphores).
    
    ```python
    sem = asyncio.Semaphore(10)
    
    async with sem:
        # work with shared resource
    ```
    

### [pip](pip.md)

* New: Requirements files structure.

# Other

* New: Retrying library for Python.

    ```python
    from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential
    
    @retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=0.1))
    def somefunction():
      raise Exception
    ```
    
    The function will be retried a maximum of 3 times, waiting 0.1 s, 0.2 s and 0.4
    s between each attempt respectively.
