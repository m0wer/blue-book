* New: Conditional execution.

    To allow a step to fail without that implying failing the whole
    workflow and then execute some steps according to the result, do:
    
    ```yaml
    - name: commitizen
      id: commitizen
      continue-on-error: true
      uses: commitizen-tools/commitizen-action@0.11.0
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    
    - name: Some other task
      if: steps.commitizen.outcome == 'success'
      run: something
    ```
