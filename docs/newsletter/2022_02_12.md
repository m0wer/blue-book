# [Introduction](X.md)

    You can use `xprop` to get the name and details of any running graphic
    application by clicking on it.

## GNULinux

### [FFmpeg](ffmpeg.md)

* New: Cropping.

    ```bash
    ffmpeg -ss 30 -t 70 -i inputfile.mp3 outputfile.mp3
    ```

    * `-ss` refers to the starting time.
    * `-t` is the duration after the starting time to consider.


## Programming

### [NGINX](flutter_nginx.md)

* New: Support named routes.

    To support named routes (e.g., `APP_HOST/some/route`), add the following
    configuration to the host configuration file:

    ```nginx
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
    ```

    Otherwise NGINX will return 404 when queried for a named route since the
    corresponding file won't exist in the root directory.
