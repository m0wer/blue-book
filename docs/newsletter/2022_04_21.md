* New: Merge conflict style.

    Take the pain out of git conflict resolution: use diff3
    
    ```bash
    git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3
    ```
    
    After running this command to turn on diff3, each new conflict will have a 3rd
    section, the merged common ancestor.
    
    ```gitconflict
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    GreenMessage.send(include_signature: true)
    ||||||| merged common ancestor
    BlueMessage.send(include_signature: true)
    =======
    BlueMessage.send(include_signature: false)
    >>>>>>> merged-branch
    ```
    

* New: View file evolution.

    You can use `git log -L` to view the evolution of a range of lines. Example:
    
    ```bash
    git log -L 15,23:filename.txt
    ```
    
    means *trace the evolution of lines `15` to `23` in the file named
    `filename.txt`*.
    

* New: Compare file accross references.

    To compare a file accross references (branches, tags, commits...) do:
    
    ```bash
    git diff <reference1> <reference2> -- <file>
    ```
