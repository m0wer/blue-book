### [Basics](python_basics.md)

* New: Abstract base classes.

    [abstract base classes (ABCs)](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-abstract-base-class)
    in Python, as outlined in [PEP 3119](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3119).


* New: Enum.

    An enumeration is a set of symbolic names (members) bound to unique, constant
    values. Within an enumeration, the members can be compared by identity, and
    the enumeration itself can be iterated over.


### [pydantic](pydantic.md)

* New: Pydantic.

    [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/): data validation and settings
    management using python type annotations.

    Enforces type hints at runtime, and provides user friendly errors when data is
    invalid.


* New: Validators.

    Custom validation and complex relationships between objects can be achieved
    using the `validator` decorator.
