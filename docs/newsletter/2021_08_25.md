### [Basics](basics.md)

* New: Issubclass.

    [`issubclass(class, classinfo)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#issubclass):
    Return `True` if `class` is a subclass (direct, indirect or virtual) of
    `classinfo`. A class is considered a subclass of itself. `classinfo` may be a
    tuple of class objects, in which case every entry in `classinfo` will be
    checked. In any other case, a `TypeError` exception is raised.
    

### [FastAPI](fastapi.md)

* Improvement: Wrapping imported functions.
* New: Dependency injection.

    A FastAPI decorated function can import the necessary arguments for other
    functions or objects.
    

### [Typing](typing.md)

* New: Type.

    * `Type[Class]`: Accepts instances of the `Class` and the `Class` itself.
