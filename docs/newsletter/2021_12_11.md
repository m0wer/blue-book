### [Github Actions](github_actions.md)

* New: Concurrency.

    You can use `concurrency` to cancel any in-progress job or run. Example:

    ```yaml
    concurrency:
      group: docs-${{ github.head_ref }}
      cancel-in-progress: true
    ```

    This is useful to cancel previous jobs if new commits are pushed, which saves
    minutes, energy and avoids conflicts when pushing changes during the action.


## Programming

### [Debugging](flutter_debugging.md)

* New: Debugging Flutter.

    Import `dart:developer` and add `debugger();` wherever you want.
    Then, open your browsers developer tools and use the console.


### [pytest](pytest.md)

* New: Class fixture.

    To run a custom function for every test in a class do:

    ```python
    class TestClass:
        @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
        def setup(self):
            self.variable = 42

        def test_something(self):
            ...
    ```
