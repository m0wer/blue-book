* New: How to change themes.

    GTK is a free and open-source cross-platform widget toolkit for creating
    graphical user interfaces.
    
    To change the theme, either use `lxapparence` or manually edit
    `~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini`.
    You will be forced to do the second option if the theme is for gtk-3 only.
