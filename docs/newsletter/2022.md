## CICD

### [Github Actions](github_actions.md)

* New: Store file as a secret.

    If you want to store a file (multiline, binary...) as a secret, first encode it
    with base64:
    
    ```bash
    base64 -i < {{ file_path }} | tr -d '\n' | xclip -i -selection clipboard
    ```
    
    Then paste it to a new secret. To restore the file diring the workflow, add:
    
    ```yaml
    - name: restore file
      run: echo ${{ secrets.SECRET }} | base64 -d > {{ file_path }}
    ```
    

* New: Conditional execution.

    To allow a step to fail without that implying failing the whole
    workflow and then execute some steps according to the result, do:
    
    ```yaml
    - name: commitizen
      id: commitizen
      continue-on-error: true
      uses: commitizen-tools/commitizen-action@0.11.0
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    
    - name: Some other task
      if: steps.commitizen.outcome == 'success'
      run: something
    ```
    

## DBMS

### [Database Normalization](database_normalization.md)

* New: Add definitions and examples.

## [GNULinux](youtube-dl.md)

* New: Download only the audio in MP3.

    ```bash
    youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 [url]
    ```
    

### [Adjust external monitor brightness](script_adjust_external_monitors_brightness.md)

* New: Script to adjust external monitor brightness.

    If you want to adjust the external monitor brightness according to the main
    display, you can run the following script after every brightness change to the
    main monitor.
    
    ```bash
    
    xrandr -q | grep -q "DisplayPort-4 connected" || exit 0
    
    (
      # Wait for lock on /var/lock/adjust_external_monitors_brightness.exclusivelock (fd 200) for 20 seconds
      flock -x -w 20 200 || exit 1
    
      # main screen brightness (from 0 to 255)
      main=$(cat /sys/class/backlight/amdgpu_bl0/brightness)
    
      # external monitor
      l27_max=100 # max brightness
      l27_0=40 # equivalent brightness of main for l27 min brightness
      l27_100=255 # equivalent brightness of main for l27 max brightness
    
      # equivalent brightness for the external monitor
      l27=$(( 100 * ( (main > l27_0 ? main : l27_0) - l27_0 ) / (l27_100 - l27_0) ))
    
      # try to set it until success
      until ddccontrol -r 0x10 -w $l27 dev:/dev/i2c-11 | grep -q "Writing 0x10";
      do
        sleep 1;
      done
    
    ) 200>/var/lock/adjust_external_monitors_brightness.exclusivelock
    ```
    
    You will need to make a few adjustments:
    
    * Change `DisplayPort-4` to whatever corresponds to your external monitor.
    * Change `/sys/class/backlight/amdgpu_bl0/brightness` if you use Intel.
    * Adjust the variables (`l27_max`, `l27_0`, `l27_100`).
    * Get the corresponding i2c device (change `i2c-11`) by running `ddccontrol -p`.
    

### [Alacritty](alacritty.md)

* New: Setup remote shell automatically.

    An useful`zsh` function is:
    
    ```zshrc
    s () {
        infocmp | ssh $@ 'tic -x /dev/stdin'
        ssh $@
    }
    ```
    
    Which will setup the shell always before connecting.
    

### [Android](android.md)

* New: Automatic version code generation.

    If you use semantic versioning and you don't want to increment the version code
    manually, replace the  related config from `android/app/build.gradle` with:
    
    ```java
    def flutterVersionName = localProperties.getProperty('flutter.versionName')
    if (flutterVersionName == null) {
        flutterVersionName = '1.0.0'
    }
    
    def semanticVersion = flutterVersionName.split('\\+')
    def versionCore = semanticVersion[0]
    def build = semanticVersion.length >= 2 ? semanticVersion[1].toInteger() : 0
    def (major, minor, patch) = versionCore.tokenize('.').collect{it.toInteger()}
    def flutterVersionCode = 1000000 * major + 10000 * minor + 100 * patch + build
    ```
    
    Then whenever `pubspec.yaml` `version` veriable changes and you build an APK or
    appbundle, the version code will be generated from it.
    
    Examples (version name -> version code):
    
    * `1.2.0` -> `1020000`
    * `3.0.1+99` -> `3000199`
    

* New: Signing the APK/AppBundle.

    First of all, create a key if you don't have one with:
    
    ```bash
    keytool -genkey -v -keystore {{ keystore_file }} -alias {{ key_alias }} \
      -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10000
    ```
    
    Replace `signingConfigs` with:
    
    ```java
      signingConfigs {
           release {
            keyAlias "$System.env.KEY_ALIAS"
            keyPassword "$System.env.KEY_PASSWORD"
            storeFile file("$System.env.KEY_PATH")
            storePassword "$System.env.STORE_PASSWORD"
        }
       }
       buildTypes {
           release {
               signingConfig signingConfigs.release
           }
       }
    ```
    
    Now, you can set the corresponding environment variables. This configuration is
    particularily useful if you want to have a CI build and sign the releases.
    
    Check [store file as secret](github_actions#store-file-as-secret) to save the
    generated keystore file as a CI secret.
    

### [APT](apt.md)

* New: List all installed packages and their versions.

    ```bash
    apt list --installed
    ```
    

### [Bash](bash.md)

* New: Get min or max from two variables.

    ```bash
    $((VAR > 10 ? VAR : 10))
    ```
    

* New: Run a command until the ouptut contains some text.

    ```bash
    until somecommand | grep -q "Up to date";
    do
      sleep 1;
    done
    ```
    

* New: Flcok.

    To ensure only one instance of the script runs some code, you can use `flock`
    as follows:
    
    ```bash
    (
      # Wait for lock on /var/lock/.myscript.exclusivelock (fd 200) for 10 seconds
      flock -x -w 10 200 || exit 1
    
      # Do stuff
    
    ) 200>/var/lock/.myscript.exclusivelock
    ```
    

* New: Beep alert.

    You can generate a beep alert (if enabled in the system) and a window highlight
    with:
    
    ```bash
    echo -e "\a"
    ```

    To push the local tags to the remote server:
    
    ```bash
    git push --tags
    ```
    

* New: Move last n commits to a new branch.

    So you forgot to create a feature branch ah? No problem, let's move the last
    few unpushed commits to a new branch:
    
    ```bash
    git checkout -b new_branch # create a new branch from the current one
    git checkout old_branch # go back to the original branch
    git reset --hard HEAD~3 # undo the last 3 commits
    git checkout new_branch # go to the new branch and continue there
    ```
    

* New: Modify specific commit message.

    ```bash
    git rebase --interactive '<commit-id>^'
    ```
    
    Then replace `pick` with `r` and save to modify the commit message.
    

* New: Merge conflict style.

    Take the pain out of git conflict resolution: use diff3
    
    ```bash
    git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3
    ```
    
    After running this command to turn on diff3, each new conflict will have a 3rd
    section, the merged common ancestor.
    
    ```gitconflict
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    GreenMessage.send(include_signature: true)
    ||||||| merged common ancestor
    BlueMessage.send(include_signature: true)
    =======
    BlueMessage.send(include_signature: false)
    >>>>>>> merged-branch
    ```
    

* New: View file evolution.

    You can use `git log -L` to view the evolution of a range of lines. Example:
    
    ```bash
    git log -L 15,23:filename.txt
    ```
    
    means *trace the evolution of lines `15` to `23` in the file named
    `filename.txt`*.
    

* New: Compare file accross references.

    To compare a file accross references (branches, tags, commits...) do:
    
    ```bash
    git diff <reference1> <reference2> -- <file>
    ```
    

* New: Revert file to specific commit.

    ```bash
    git checkout c5f567 -- file1/to/restore file2/to/restore
    ```
    

### [GPG](gpg.md)

* New: Generate a key.

    Use `gpg --gen-key` or `gpg --full-gen-key` for more options.
    

* New: Export public key.

    ```bash
    gpg --output public.pgp --armor --export username@email
    ```
    

### [grep](grep.md)

* New: Common options.

    * `-r`: recursively search a directory.
    * `-i`: ignore case.
    * `-l`: print only the path of the files that have at least one match.
    

* New: Limit results line length.

    First 400 bytes of the line:
    
    ```bash
    grep "foobar" * | cut -b 1-400
    ```
    
    This might leave the match out, but it's simple to use and enough for most
    cases. The other option is:
    
    ```bash
    grep -rEo ".{0,10}wantedText.{0,10}" *
    ```
    

### [GTK](gtk.md)

* New: How to change themes.

    GTK is a free and open-source cross-platform widget toolkit for creating
    graphical user interfaces.
    
    To change the theme, either use `lxapparence` or manually edit
    `~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini`.
    You will be forced to do the second option if the theme is for gtk-3 only.

### [i3 window manager](i3wm.md)

* New: Get pressed key name.

    Some key names are hard to guess, such as `XF86AudioRaiseVolume`, and you need
    their name to use them in bindings. You can use `xev` for that.
    

### [LibreOffice](libreoffice.md)

* New: LibreOffice Calc IF().

    Syntax: `IF(Test, Then Value, Otherwise Value)`.
    
    Example:
    
    ```excel
    =IF(A2>500,"High","Low")
    ```
    

### [Makefile](makefile.md)

* New: Paralelize steps.

    Add the following lines to the beginning of the *Makefile*:

    * `cs)]`: Change the parentheses surrounding the text inside parentheses to
      square brackets.
    

* New: Edit remote files with SSH.

    Just run:
    
    ```bash
    nvim scp://user@host//tmp/file
    ```
    
    Notice the extra `/`. You can also specify just a directory to browse it
    interactively.
    

* New: Cherry pick lines to commit.

    [tpope/vim-fugitive: fugitive.vim: A Git wrapper so awesome, it should be illegal](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
    
    1. Open the git summary with :Git (or :G).
    1. Expand the file which contains the lines you want to stage with `>`
      (or `=` to toggle). This will only show the changed chunks plus some extra
      lines of context above and below the changed lines.
    1. `V` to start visual mode and select the lines you want to stage with `hjkl`.
    1. `s` to stage the visual selection (or `-` to toggle)
    1. Repeat 2-4 as needed
    1. `cc` to commit
    

* New: Search for visual selection.

    ```vimrc
    vnoremap // y/\V<C-R>=escape(@",'/\')<CR><CR>
    ```
    To use the mapping, visually select the characters that are wanted in the
    search, then type `//` to search for the next occurrence of the selected text.
    

* New: Marks.

    A mark allows you to record your current position so you can return to it
    later.
    
    Usage:
    
    * `:marks`: show existing marks.
    * `ma`: set mark `a` in current position of current file, accessible only from
      the current file.
    * `mA`: set mark `A` in current position of current file, accessible from
      anywhere.
    * `'a`: Go to mark `a`.
    * `]'`: jump to next line with a lowercase mark.
    

* New: Sed replace with newline.
* New: Without RegEx.

    Use `:sno` instead of `:s` to disable magic.
    

* New: Shortcut to open previous buffer.

    Open the previous buffer: `<C-^>` (or `<C-6>` in some keyboards).
    

### [OpenLDAP](openldap.md)

* New: Show special entries and attributes in search.

    ```bash
    ldapsearch [...] +
    ```
    

### [PostgreSQL](postgresql.md)

* New: Check that a string is a valid timezone.

    Use the constraint `CHECK (now() AT TIME ZONE timezone IS NOT NULL)`. For
    example:
    
    ```psql
    CREATE TABLE locations (
        location_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        name TEXT,
        timezone TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (now() AT TIME ZONE timezone IS NOT NULL)
    );
    ```
    

* New: Get the 20 slowest queries.

    ```psql
    SELECT substring(query, 1, 50) AS short_query,
                  round(total_time::numeric, 2) AS total_time,
                  calls,
                  round(mean_time::numeric, 2) AS mean,
                  round((100 * total_time / sum(total_time::numeric) OVER ())::numeric, 2) AS percentage_cpu
    FROM  pg_stat_statements
    ORDER BY total_time DESC
    LIMIT 20;
    ```
    

* New: Count NULL values.

    ```psql
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table WHERE column IS NULL;
    ```
    `COUNT` only conseiders non null values so use `COUNT(*)` (which counts the
    row) instead of `COUNT(column)` because the later would always return 0 since
    the filter gets only the null values of `column`.
    

* New: Stop remote connections.

    Some operations, like dropping a database, require that the database has no connections. To stop all remote connections and prevent them from connecting again, do:
    
    ```psql
    ALTER DATABASE somedatabase ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = OFF;
    
    SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)
    FROM pg_stat_activity
    WHERE datname = 'somedatabase';
    ```
    
    But if you are using PostgreSQL 13 or above, for dropping a table you can directly do:
    
    ```psql
    DROP DATABASE db_name WITH (FORCE);
    ```
    

* New: List databases.

    ```psql
    \l
    ```
    

### [Profanity](profanity.md)

    * `\omemo start`: Start an OMEMO session.
    

### [PulseAudio](pulseaudio.md)

* New: Restart PulseAudio.

    ```bash
    pulseaudio -k
    ```
    

### [sed](sed.md)

* New: Use matched pattern.

    ```bash
    echo "foobarbaz" | sed 's/^foo\(.*\)baz$/\1/'
    ```
    
    Returns `bar`.
    

### [Wallabag](wallabag.md)

* New: Block all feeds except starred.

    ```nginx
    location ~ /feed/sgn/{token}/(?!starred) {
       deny all;
       return 403;
      }
    ```
    

* Correction: Missing placeholder.

## [Hardware](t14_amd_gen1.md)

* New: Sticky touchpad after suspend.

    After suspension, the touchpad behaves weird: can't scroll, and acts as if you
    were clicking and dragging (sticky). The TrackPoint works correctly though.
    
    A first solution was to disable it and just use the TrackPoint. This is done
    as follows:
    
    ```bash
    xinput list # look for SynPS/2 Synaptics TouchPad
    xinput set-prop <number> "Device Enabled" 0
    ```
    
    This allows you to use the computer without the sticky mouse annoyance but
    doesn't actually solve the problem. For that, the solution that worked for me
    is removing the `psmouse` kernel module before suspending and then reloading it
    after waking up from suspension. You can first try to do this manualy and then
    if it works create this script in `/lib/systemd/system-sleep/psmouse`:
    
    ```bash
    
    case $1/$2 in
      pre/*)
        echo "Going to $2..."
        modprobe -r psmouse
        ;;
      post/*)
        echo "Waking up from $2..."
        sleep 2
        modprobe psmouse
        ;;
    esac
    ```
    

## Programming

### [basics](javascript_basics.md)

* Reorganization: Renamed file.
* New: Recursively log object.

    If you `console.log()` an object, only the first levels of it will be shown.
    To recursively log the whole object, use:
    
    ```javascript
    console.dir(yourObject, { depth: null });
    ```
    

* New: Map a dictionary to a dictionary.

    ```javascript
    Object.fromEntries(Object.entries(obj).map(([k, v]) => [k, v["someKey"]]));
    ```
    

* New: Enum.

    There is no `Enum` in JavaScript but you can use:
    
    ```javascript
    Object.freeze({ Apple: 0, Banana: 1, Cherry: 2});
    ```
    

* New: Pyhton AIOHTTP.

    Basic example:
    
    ```python
    import aiohttp
    import asyncio
    
    async def main():
        async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
            async with session.get('http://httpbin.org/get') as resp:
                print(resp.status)
                print(await resp.text())
    
    asyncio.run(main)
    ```
    
    Other methods:
    
    ```python
    session.put('http://httpbin.org/put', data=b'data')
    session.delete('http://httpbin.org/delete')
    session.head('http://httpbin.org/get')
    session.options('http://httpbin.org/get')
    session.patch('http://httpbin.org/patch', data=b'data')
    `
    

* New: Headers.

    ```python
    headers = {

    {% for row in table %}
      <tr>
      {% set rowloop = loop %}
      {% for cell in row %}
        <td id="cell-{{ rowloop.index }}-{{ loop.index }}">{{ cell }}</td>
      {% endfor %}
      </tr>
    {% endfor %}
    </table>
    ```

### [Typing](typing.md)

* New:  Awaitable type.

    * `Awaitable`: Promise/Future.
    

* New: F821 undefined name when class method return type is the class name.

    Since the class is not defined yet, to use it as the return type that a class
    method returns you need to:
    
    ```bash
    from __future__ import annotations
    ```
    

## Theory

### [Algorithms](union_find.md)

* New: Add union-find data structure definition and algorithms.

    In computer science, a disjoint-set data structure, also called a union–find
    data structure or merge–find set, is a data structure that stores a collection
    of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets.
    
    It can be used to store the connected components of an undirected graph.
    
    An example could be:
    
    ```text
    
    0   1---2   3---4
    
    5---6   7   8   9
    ```
    
    * *N* is the number of nodes. Equals to *10* in the example.
    
    The data structure should support the following operations:
    
    * **initialize()**: Set the initial state of the graph.
    * **find(p, q)**: Are nodes **p** and **q** connected?
    * **union(p,q)**: Connect nodes **p** and **q**.

## Books

### [Atlas Shrugged](atlas_shrugged.md)

* New: Atlas Shrugged 1957 novel by Ayn Rand.

    Atlas Shrugged is a 1957 novel by Ayn Rand. It contains Rand's most extensive
    statement of Objectivism. The book depicts a dystopian United States in which
    private businesses suffer under increasingly burdensome laws and regulations.
    
    The book is more than a thousand pages long. There are audiobooks (~60h long)
    and a movie divided in three parts.
    

### [The Problem of Political Authority](the_problem_of_political_authority.md)

* New: The Problem of Political Authority.

    Modern states commonly deploy coercion in a wide array of circumstances in
    which the resort to force would clearly be wrong for any private agent. What
    entitles the state to behave in this manner? And why should citizens obey its
    commands? This book examines theories of political authority, from the social
    contract theory, to theories of democratic authorization, to fairness- and
    consequence-based theories. Ultimately, no theory of authority succeeds, and
    thus no government has the kind of authority often ascribed to governments.
    
    The author goes on to discuss how voluntary and competitive institutions could
    provide the central goods for the sake of which the state is often deemed
    necessary, including law, protection from private criminals, and national
    security. An orderly and livable society thus does not require acquiescence in
    the illusion of political authority.

    ...
    value = value ?? 2;
    ```
    

* New: Request a new certificate.

    If there is no HTTP sever running:
    
    ```bash
    certbot certonly --standalone --preferred-challenges http-01 -d {{ domain }} --register-unsafely-without-email --agree-tos -n
    ```
    
    If there is an HTTP running:
    
    ```bash
    certonly --webroot -w {{ web_path_letsencrypt }} --preferred-challenges http-01 -d {{ domain }} --register-unsafely-without-email --agree-tos -n
    ```
    

* Correction: Add missing entries to nav.
* New: Upload to Play Store with CI.

    1. Create a *principal* in <https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam>
      with the role *Service Account User*.
    1. Create and download a new key (JSON format) for the created *principal*.
    1. In [Play Console](https://play.google.com/console/) go to Setup>API access
      and enable access for the created *principal* granting
      *Admin (all permissions)* to it.
    1. Add the key JSON content as a GitHub Secret (e.g., `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`).
    1. Add the following step to your workflow (after `flutter build appbundle`):
    
      ```yaml
      - name: Upload to Google Play
        uses: r0adkll/upload-google-play@v1.0.15
        with:
          serviceAccountJsonPlainText: ${{ secrets.SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON }}
          packageName: {{ package_name }}
          releaseFiles: build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
          track: production
      ```
    

* New: Support named routes.

    To support named routes (e.g., `APP_HOST/some/route`), add the following
    configuration to the host configuration file:
    
    ```nginx
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
    ```
    
    Otherwise NGINX will return 404 when queried for a named route since the
    corresponding file won't exist in the root directory.
    

* New: Array find method.

    `.find()`: returns the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no values satisfy the testing function, `undefined` is returned. E.g., `array1.find(element => element > 10)`.
    

* New: Iterate keys and values.

    ```javascript
    for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(object)) {
      console.log(key, value);
    }
    ```
    

* Reorganization: Renamed duplicated filenames.
