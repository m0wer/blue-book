* New: Limit concurrency.

    Use
    [`asyncio.Semaphore`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-sync.html#semaphores).
    
    ```python
    sem = asyncio.Semaphore(10)
    
    async with sem:
        # work with shared resource
    ```
    

# Other

* New: Retrying library for Python.

    ```python
    from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential
    
    @retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=0.1))
    def somefunction():
      raise Exception
    ```
    
    The function will be retried a maximum of 3 times, waiting 0.1 s, 0.2 s and 0.4
    s between each attempt respectively.
