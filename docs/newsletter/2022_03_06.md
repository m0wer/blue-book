* New: Add union-find data structure definition and algorithms.

    In computer science, a disjoint-set data structure, also called a union–find
    data structure or merge–find set, is a data structure that stores a collection
    of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets.
    
    It can be used to store the connected components of an undirected graph.
    
    An example could be:
    
    ```text
    
    0   1---2   3---4
    
    5---6   7   8   9
    ```
    
    * *N* is the number of nodes. Equals to *10* in the example.
    
    The data structure should support the following operations:
    
    * **initialize()**: Set the initial state of the graph.
    * **find(p, q)**: Are nodes **p** and **q** connected?
    * **union(p,q)**: Connect nodes **p** and **q**.
