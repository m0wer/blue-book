### [i3 window manager](i3wm.md)

* New: Get pressed key name.

    Some key names are hard to guess, such as `XF86AudioRaiseVolume`, and you need
    their name to use them in bindings. You can use `xev` for that.
    

### [neovim](neovim.md)

* New: Cherry pick lines to commit.

    [tpope/vim-fugitive: fugitive.vim: A Git wrapper so awesome, it should be illegal](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
    
    1. Open the git summary with :Git (or :G).
    1. Expand the file which contains the lines you want to stage with `>`
      (or `=` to toggle). This will only show the changed chunks plus some extra
      lines of context above and below the changed lines.
    1. `V` to start visual mode and select the lines you want to stage with `hjkl`.
    1. `s` to stage the visual selection (or `-` to toggle)
    1. Repeat 2-4 as needed
    1. `cc` to commit
    

### [OpenLDAP](openldap.md)

* New: Show special entries and attributes in search.

    ```bash
    ldapsearch [...] +
    ```
