## Programming

### [Basics](basics.md)

* New: Add datetime.timestamp() method.
* New: Change function default argument.

### [FastAPI](fastapi.md)

* New: HTTP API from Python type hints.

    [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a modern, fast
    (high-performance), web framework for building HTTP APIs based on
    standard Python type hints.
    

* New: Add route to other module functions.

    There are two main ways of using this module, with the decorator
    `@app.get("{{route}}")` or with
    `FastAPI().add_route("{{route}}", {{function}})`.
    
    The first alternative is by far the most common, but if you want to separate
    the functions from the HTTP API entrypoint, you have to use the second option.
    
    The advantage of this alternative is that we can import the function
    from another module.
    

### [pytest](pytest.md)

* New: How to invoke pytest.

    Invoke with `python -m pytest` so that the current directory is
    included to the python path.
    

### [statsmodels](statsmodels.md)

* New: Linear regression tutorial.
