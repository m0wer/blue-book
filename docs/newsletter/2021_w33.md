## GNULinux

### [Bash](bash.md)

* New: Remove an environment variable.

    To remove an exported environment variable use:

    ```bash
    unset VARIABLE
    ```


## Programming

### [Basics](python_basics.md)

* New: Abstract base classes.

    [abstract base classes (ABCs)](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-abstract-base-class)
    in Python, as outlined in [PEP 3119](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3119).


* New: Enum.

    An enumeration is a set of symbolic names (members) bound to unique, constant
    values. Within an enumeration, the members can be compared by identity, and
    the enumeration itself can be iterated over.


* New: Custom exceptions.

    To provide more insightful error messages related to our code, we can create
    custom exceptions. For example:

    ```python
    class ColorError(ValueError):
        def __init__(self, color):
            message = f"Invalid color {color}."
            super().__init__(message)
    ```


* New: String remove prefix suffix methods.

    * `str.removeprefix(prefix)`: If the string starts with the prefix string,
      return `str[len(prefix):]`. Otherwise, return a copy of the original string.
    * `str.removesuffix(suffix)`: If the string ends with the suffix string and
      that suffix is not empty, return `str[:-len(suffix)]`. Otherwise, return a
      copy of the original string.


* New: Current local date and time.
* New: TypedDict.

    Special construct to add type hints to a dictionary. At runtime it is a plain
    `dict`.

    Example:

    ```python
    class Point2D(TypedDict):
        x: int
        y: int
        label: str

    a: Point2D = {'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'label': 'good'}  # OK
    b: Point2D = {'z': 3, 'label': 'bad'}           # Fails type check
    ```


### [Docstrings](docstrings.md)

* New: Python docstrings.

    A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module,
    function, class, or method definition. Such a docstring becomes the `__doc__`
    special attribute of that object. See
    [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)


### [mypy](mypy.md)

* New: Mypy.

    [`mypy`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a static type checker for Python.


* New: Ignore line for type checking.

    To ignore type checking in one particular line of the code, add the comment
    `# type: ignore` at the end of that line


### [pydantic](pydantic.md)

* New: Pydantic.

    [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/): data validation and settings
    management using python type annotations.

    Enforces type hints at runtime, and provides user friendly errors when data is
    invalid.


* New: Validators.

    Custom validation and complex relationships between objects can be achieved
    using the `validator` decorator.


* New: Validators advanced use.
* New: Root_validator.

    Validation can also be performed on the entire model's data.


### [pytest](pytest.md)

* New: Coverage.py.

    To see which parts of your code are executed when running the tests, you can
    use [Coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/).


### [requests](requests.md)

* New: Python requests library.

    [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) is an elegant and
    simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings.


### [Snippets](snippets.md)

* New: Find in dictionary.

    Find first element  in dictionary that satisfies a condition:

    ```python
    next(item for item in {dict} if {{ condition }})
    ```


# Other

* New: Breakpoint().

     Since Python 3.7, we can just call `breakpoint()` and this will import
     [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html)
     (or the debugger defined in the environment variable `PYTHONBREAKPOINT`) and
     set the breakpoint in that part of the code. This will stop the program
     execution once the breakpoint is reached. Then, an interactive console while
     appear.


* New: Order of abstractmethod classmethod.

    Use `@abstractmethod` before `classmethod`. See
    [Issue 16267](https://bugs.python.org/issue16267).
