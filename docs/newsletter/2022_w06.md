## Programming

### [Jinja](jinja.md)

* New: Accessing the parent Loop.

    The special loop variable always points to the innermost loop. If it’s desired
    to have access to an outer loop it’s possible to alias it:
    
    ```jinja
    <table>
    {% for row in table %}
      <tr>
      {% set rowloop = loop %}
      {% for cell in row %}
        <td id="cell-{{ rowloop.index }}-{{ loop.index }}">{{ cell }}</td>
      {% endfor %}
      </tr>
    {% endfor %}
    </table>
    ```
    

### [NGINX](flutter/nginx.md)

* New: Support named routes.

    To support named routes (e.g., `APP_HOST/some/route`), add the following
    configuration to the host configuration file:
    
    ```nginx
    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }
    ```
    
    Otherwise NGINX will return 404 when queried for a named route since the
    corresponding file won't exist in the root directory.
