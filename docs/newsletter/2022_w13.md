### [Adjust external monitor brightness](script_adjust_external_monitors_brightness.md)

* New: Script to adjust external monitor brightness.

    If you want to adjust the external monitor brightness according to the main
    display, you can run the following script after every brightness change to the
    main monitor.
    
    ```bash
    
    xrandr -q | grep -q "DisplayPort-4 connected" || exit 0
    
    (
      # Wait for lock on /var/lock/adjust_external_monitors_brightness.exclusivelock (fd 200) for 20 seconds
      flock -x -w 20 200 || exit 1
    
      # main screen brightness (from 0 to 255)
      main=$(cat /sys/class/backlight/amdgpu_bl0/brightness)
    
      # external monitor
      l27_max=100 # max brightness
      l27_0=40 # equivalent brightness of main for l27 min brightness
      l27_100=255 # equivalent brightness of main for l27 max brightness
    
      # equivalent brightness for the external monitor
      l27=$(( 100 * ( (main > l27_0 ? main : l27_0) - l27_0 ) / (l27_100 - l27_0) ))
    
      # try to set it until success
      until ddccontrol -r 0x10 -w $l27 dev:/dev/i2c-11 | grep -q "Writing 0x10";
      do
        sleep 1;
      done
    
    ) 200>/var/lock/adjust_external_monitors_brightness.exclusivelock
    ```
    
    You will need to make a few adjustments:
    
    * Change `DisplayPort-4` to whatever corresponds to your external monitor.
    * Change `/sys/class/backlight/amdgpu_bl0/brightness` if you use Intel.
    * Adjust the variables (`l27_max`, `l27_0`, `l27_100`).
    * Get the corresponding i2c device (change `i2c-11`) by running `ddccontrol -p`.
    

### [Bash](bash.md)

* New: Get min or max from two variables.

    Use the ternary operator. For example, for `MAX(10, $VAR)` do:
    
    ```bash
    $((VAR > 10 ? VAR : 10))
    ```
    

* New: Run a command until the ouptut contains some text.

    ```bash
    until somecommand | grep -q "Up to date";
    do
      sleep 1;
    done
    ```
    

* New: Flcok.

    To ensure only one instance of the script runs some code, you can use `flock`
    as follows:
    
    ```bash
    (
      # Wait for lock on /var/lock/.myscript.exclusivelock (fd 200) for 10 seconds
      flock -x -w 10 200 || exit 1
    
      # Do stuff
    
    ) 200>/var/lock/.myscript.exclusivelock
    ```
    

* New: Beep alert.

    You can generate a beep alert (if enabled in the system) and a window highlight
    with:
    
    ```bash
    echo -e "\a"
    ```
    

### [Git](git.md)

* New: Show commit information.

    To see the information of a particular commit use:
    
    ```bash
    git show <revhash>
    ```
    

* New: Push tags.

    To push the local tags to the remote server:
    
    ```bash
    git push --tags
    ```
    

### [GPG](gpg.md)

* New: Generate a key.

    Use `gpg --gen-key` or `gpg --full-gen-key` for more options.
    

* New: Export public key.

    ```bash
    gpg --output public.pgp --armor --export username@email
    ```
    

### [PostgreSQL](postgresql.md)

* New: Stop remote connections.

    Some operations, like dropping a database, require that the database has no connections. To stop all remote connections and prevent them from connecting again, do:
    
    ```psql
    ALTER DATABASE somedatabase ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = OFF;
    
    SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)
    FROM pg_stat_activity
    WHERE datname = 'somedatabase';
    ```
    
    But if you are using PostgreSQL 13 or above, for dropping a table you can directly do:
    
    ```psql
    DROP DATABASE db_name WITH (FORCE);
    ```
    

* New: List databases.

    ```psql
    \l
    ```
    

## Programming

### [basics](javascript_basics.md)

* Reorganization: Renamed file.
* New: Recursively log object.

    If you `console.log()` an object, only the first levels of it will be shown.
    To recursively log the whole object, use:
    
    ```javascript
    console.dir(yourObject, { depth: null });
    ```
    

* New: Map a dictionary to a dictionary.

    ```javascript
    Object.fromEntries(Object.entries(obj).map(([k, v]) => [k, v["someKey"]]));
    ```
    

* New: Enum.

    There is no `Enum` in JavaScript but you can use:
    
    ```javascript
    Object.freeze({ Apple: 0, Banana: 1, Cherry: 2});
    ```
    

### [pip](pip.md)

* New: Install.

    Options:
    
    * `--ignore-installed`: Ignore the installed packages, overwriting them.
    

### [pydantic](pydantic.md)

* New: Logging.

    To add custom log messages to the `uvicorn` output, the dirty way, get the
    logger called `uvicorn`:
    
    ```python
    logger = logging.getLogger("uvicorn")
    ```
    

# Other

* Reorganization: Renamed duplicated filenames.
