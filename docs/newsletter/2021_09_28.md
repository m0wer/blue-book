### [Git](git.md)

* New: Pre-commit.

    [pre-commit/pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) is a
    framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks.
    
    You can skip specific hooks with:
    
    ```bash
    SKIP=no-commit-to-branch pre-commit run --all-files
    ```
    
    Which is useful if a CI runs for the main branch so that it doesn't complain
    about running in it.
    

### [netcat](netcat.md)

* New: Test TCP connections.

    ```bash
    nc -v -z -w 3 [host] [port]
    ```
    
    Options:
      * `-v`: verbose
      * `-z`: just check if the port is open and exit (without sending any data)
      * `-w 3`: 3 seconds timeout
    
    If it exists with return code 0, it means that the connection succeeded.
    

### [wget](wget.md)

* New: Redirect output to stdout.

    ```bash
    wget -qO- [url]
    ```
