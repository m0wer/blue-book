* New: Add patch realted commands.

    To create a patch of the current unstaged changes:
    
    ```bash
    git diff > patch.diff
    ```
    
    To apply a patch:
    
    ```bash
    git apply patch.diff
    ```
    
    Or if you have it in your clipboard, just run `git apply` and paste it.
