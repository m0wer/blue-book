* New: Altgr-intl layout.

    My favorite layout is [altgr-intl](https://altgr-weur.eu/altgr-intl.html)
    because it is based on the standard US layout, which is comfortable for
    programming and allows me to write accents on letters (required for Spanish
    and French). And by adding some modifications it can be used for Turkish too.
