## Quotes

> I swear by my life and my love of it that I will never live for the sake of
another man, nor ask another man to live for mine.

> Who is John Galt?

> If you saw Atlas, the giant who holds the world on his shoulders, if you saw
that he stood, blood running down his chest, his knees buckling, his arms
trembling but still trying to hold the world aloft with the last of his
strength, and the greater his effort the heavier the world bore down upon
his shoulders - What would you tell him?<br><br>
I…don't know. What…could he do? What would you tell him?<br><br>
To shrug.

> Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark in the hopeless
swamps of the not-quite, the not-yet, and the not-at-all. Do not let the hero
in your soul perish in lonely frustration for the life you deserved and have
never been able to reach. The world you desire can be won. It exists.. it is
real.. it is possible.. it's yours.”
