A basic definition of one is as follows class Whatever : def __init__ ( self , arg ): self . arg = arg var = 3 def function ( self , n ): ... where arg is an argument that then becomes an attribute of the generated instance, var is another attribute and function is a method of the class. A more extensive definition can be found at python-docs . To get the class attributes of an object, do object.__dict__ . Mapping Types (dict) \u2691 A mapping object maps hashable values to arbitrary objects. Mappings are mutable objects. There is currently only one standard mapping type, the dictionary. setdefault \u2691 setdefault(key[, default]) : If key is in the dictionary, return its value. If not, insert key with a value of default and return default . default defaults to None . Rename a dictionary key \u2691 mydict [ k_new ] = mydict . pop ( k_old ) Ranges \u2691 A range is a Python built-in type that represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is commonly used for looping a specific number of times in for loops. Some examples are for i in range ( end ): print ( i ) for i in range ( start , stop , step ): print ( i ) To reverse the order in the range you can do reversed ( range ( n )) String \u2691 Methods \u2691 str.count(sub[, start[, end]]) : Return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of substring sub in the range [ start , end ]. str.removeprefix(prefix) : If the string starts with the prefix string, return str[len(prefix):] . Otherwise, return a copy of the original string. str.removesuffix(suffix) : If the string ends with the suffix string and that suffix is not empty, return str[:-len(suffix)] . Otherwise, return a copy of the original string. str.strip([chars]) : Return a copy of the string with the leading and trailing characters removed. Enum \u2691 Example: from enum import Enum class Color ( Enum ): RED = 1 GREEN = 2 BLUE = 3 >>> Color ( 1 ) < Color . RED : 1 > >>> Color ( 3 ) < Color . BLUE : 3 > >>> Color [ 'RED' ] < Color . RED : 1 > >>> Color [ 'GREEN' ] < Color . GREEN : 2 > >>> member = Color . RED >>> member . name 'RED' >>> member . value 1 Built-in functions \u2691 enumerate \u2691 To iterate over a list keys and values use enumerate() . Example: some_list = [ 'a' , 'b' , 'c' ] for index , value in enumerate ( some_list ): ... filter \u2691 Use filter(function, iterable) to construct an iterator from those elements of iterable for which function returns true. getattr \u2691 getattr ( object , name [, default ]) Return the value of the named attribute of object . name must be a string. If the string is the name of one of the object's attributes, the result is the value of that attribute. If the named attribute does not exist, default is returned if provided, otherwise AttributeError is raised. isinstance \u2691 To check if an object is an instance of a class use isinstance(object, class) . For example: d = { \"a\" : 4 } isinstance ( d , dict ) issubclass \u2691 issubclass(class, classinfo) : Return True if class is a subclass (direct, indirect or virtual) of classinfo . A class is considered a subclass of itself. classinfo may be a tuple of class objects, in which case every entry in classinfo will be checked. In any other case, a TypeError exception is raised. Sort \u2691 To sort the objects of a list based on an attribute of them you can do list . sort ( key = lambda x : x . attribute , reverse = True ) # Higher first This fragment comes from stackoverflow . Other functions \u2691 Shuffle \u2691 To shuffle the elements order inside a list you can do from random import shuffle x = [ i for i in range ( 10 )] shuffle ( x ) This fragment comes from stackoverflow . Generic Operating System Services \u2691 os \u2691 listdir \u2691 os.listdir(path='.') returns a list containing the names of the entries in the directory given by path . Text processing services \u2691 re \u2691 The re module provides regular expression matching operations similar to those found in Perl. Usage \u2691 Check if string matches a pattern \u2691 The usage is re.match(pattern, string) . Example: import re string = \"whatever\" if re . match ( \"what.*\" , string ): print ( \"yes\" ) Tips \u2691 Try your RegEx at Pythex . time \u2691 The module time provides various time-related functions. Usage \u2691 Measure elapsed time between two points \u2691 To measure elapsed time between two points do: import time start = time . time () print ( \"hello\" ) end = time . time () print ( end - start ) Data types \u2691 datetime \u2691 Methods \u2691 timestamp() : Return POSIX timestamp. now() : Return the current local date and time. Instance methods \u2691 isoformat() : ISO 8601 formatted string. enum \u2691 An enumeration is a set of symbolic names (members) bound to unique, constant values. Within an enumeration, the members can be compared by identity, and the enumeration itself can be iterated over. Example: from enum import Enum class Color ( Enum ): RED = 1 GREEN = 2 BLUE = 3 isinstance ( Color . GREEN , Color ) # True color = Color . RED color . name # RED color . value # 1 Enumeration members are hashable, so they can be used in dictionaries and sets. I/O \u2691 Files \u2691 You can operate with files from a filesystem directly from python. A common way of doing so is f = open ( '[file]' , '[mode]' ) Where [file] is the file path and [mode] is one of the following modes: w : For rewritting the file. r : For reading from the file. a : For appending at the end of the file. Then you can use the following methods (depending on the selected mode): f . write ( 'test' ) f . read () ... Nevertheless, it is a good practice to use the with keyword when dealing with file objects, since it will automatically close it after the work is done. It can be used as follows with open ( 'file_path' ) as f : file_data = f . read () Otherwise, f.close() should be called in order to close the file and thus freeing up any system resource used by it. String formatting \u2691 Formatted string literals (f-strings) \u2691 Formatted string literals (also called f-strings for short) let you include the value of Python expressions inside a string by prefixing the string with f or F and writing expressions as {expression} . For example: name = \"robot\" print ( f \"Hello { name } \" ) Scientific notation for numbers \u2691 To print a number using scientific notation with n decimals, do number = 0.000123 print ( \"{:. {n} e}\" . format ( number )) which will return 1.23e-04 with n=2 . Get the name of the weekday \u2691 To get the name of the weekday of a datetime object use .strftime(\"%A\") . For example: >>> from datetime import datetime as date >>> date . today () . strftime ( \"%A\" ) 'Monday' Internet protocols and support \u2691 http.server \u2691 You can create a basic HTTP server that serves the files in the current directory with mkdir /tmp/www echo \"Hello world!\" > /tmp/index.html cd /tmp/www ; python3 -m http.server if you want to leave it running in the background even if you close the console session, do nohup python3 -m http.server & instead. Built-in exceptions \u2691 Most common: TypeError : Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type. ValueError : Raised when an operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value. Custom exception \u2691 To provide more insightful error messages related to our code, we can create custom exceptions. For example: class ColorError ( ValueError ): def __init__ ( self , color ): message = f \"Invalid color { color } .\" super () . __init__ ( message ) Functional programming modules \u2691 functools \u2691 The functools module is for higher-order functions: functions that act on or return other functions. Usage \u2691 Change function default argument value \u2691 from functools import partial def f ( num : int = 0 ) -> str : return \"The value of num is: \" + str ( num ) f_p = partial ( f , num = 1 ) f_p () To keep the docstring of the original function, just copy it with: f_p . __doc__ = f . __doc__ Python runtime services \u2691 Abstract Base Classes \u2691 This module provides the infrastructure for defining abstract base classes (ABCs) in Python, as outlined in PEP 3119 . To create an abstract base class, to define and interface and can be inherited but not instantiated, do: from abc import ABC , abstractmethod class Switchable ( ABC ): \"\"\"Switchable interface.\"\"\" is_on : bool = False @abstractmethod def turn_on ( self ): \"\"\"Method to turn on.\"\" @abstractmethod def turn_off(self): \"\"\" Method to turn off . \"\" class LightBulb ( Switchable ): \"\"\"Light bulb class.\"\"\" def turn_on ( self ): self . is_on = True print ( \"Light is on.\" ) def turn_on ( self ): self . is_on = False print ( \"Light is off.\" ) light_bulb_1 = LightBulb () light_bulb_1 . turn_on () This code is an example for an abstract class that doesn't follow the composition over inheritance principle. It would be better to implement separate turn_on and turn_off functions that get a Switchable object as their argument. Note : Use @abstractmethod before classmethod . See Issue 16267 . Development tools \u2691 typing \u2691 Provides runtime support for type hints. Types \u2691 TypedDict \u2691 Special construct to add type hints to a dictionary. At runtime it is a plain dict . Example: class Point2D ( TypedDict ): x : int y : int label : str a : Point2D = { 'x' : 1 , 'y' : 2 , 'label' : 'good' } # OK b : Point2D = { 'z' : 3 , 'label' : 'bad' } # Fails type check By default, all keys must be present in a TypedDict . It is possible to override this by specifying totality. Usage: class point2D ( TypedDict , total = False ): x : int y : int Tips \u2691 Check syntax without running \u2691 Try to compile it: python -m py_compile script.py", "title": "Basics"}, {"location": "python_basics/#python-basics", "text": "", "title": "Python basics"}, {"location": "python_basics/#built-in-types", "text": "", "title": "Built-in types"}, {"location": "python_basics/#classes", "text": "A class is an object from which we can generate instances.

To entirely remove unwanted files from a repository's history you can use git filter-branch .

Queries ignore case, so if any column name has capital letters in it, escape it with double quotes (\"). To scape a string use single quotes ('). To select the database to work in do or ` \\c {database_name}` in short. ### Basic operations #### Delete a table ``` psql DROP TABLE \"{table_name}\" ; Add a new column \u2691 To add a new column, use ALTER TABLE . For example: ALTER TABLE { table_name } ADD IF NOT EXISTS { column_name } { data_type } GROUP BY \u2691 Reference: PostgreSQL GROUP BY UPDATE \u2691 To update the values of some columns, use UPDATE . The general basic syntax is as follows: UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1 , column2 = value2 , ... WHERE condition ; From subquery \u2691 The most efficient way appears to be the following. UPDATE { table } SET { column1 } = subquery . { column1 }, { column2 } = subquery . { column2 } FROM ({ subquery }) AS subquery WHERE { table } . { id } = subquery . { id }; Other options are to perform a JOIN but the syntax is less clear and the performance seems to be worse. Window functions \u2691 Window functions allow to perform the calculation across a set of rows related to the current row. The simplified syntax is: window_function ( arg1 , arg2 , .. ) OVER ( [ PARTITION BY partition_expression ] [ ORDER BY sort_expression [ ASC | DESC ] [ NULLS { FIRST | LAST }]) So for example a moving average of the last 28 days could be obtained with: SELECT AVG ({ column }) OVER ( ORDER BY { date_column } RANGE BETWEEN '28 day' PRECEDING AND current row ) AS rolling_average FROM { table } Query operators \u2691 NULLIF \u2691 The NULLIF(value1, value2) function returns a null value if value1 equals value2 ; otherwise it returns value1 . It can be useful for avoiding divisions by 0 (e.g. set value2 to 0). String functions and operators \u2691 Reference: PostgreSQL Documentation concat_ws \u2691 To concatenate strings with a separator, use concat_ws({separator}, {val1}, {...}) . For example: concat_ws(',', 'abcde', 2, NULL, 22) \u2192 abcde,2,22 . COUNT \u2691 Count NULL values \u2691 SELECT COUNT ( * ) FROM table WHERE column IS NULL ; COUNT only conseiders non null values so use COUNT(*) (which counts the row) instead of COUNT(column) because the later would always return 0 since the filter gets only the null values of column . Time stamp operations \u2691 Get only part of the time stamp \u2691 To get only a part of the time stamp (e.g., day, hour...) or to get it in another format (e.g., epoch), use date_part() . For example, to get the hour of a timestamp do: date_part ( 'hour' , timestamp '2001-02-16 20:38:40' ) which will return 20 . The second argument of the function can be the name of a column. If instead you want to truncate a timestamp to a specified level of precission, use date_trunc('datepart', field) . Constraints \u2691 Check that a string is a valid timezone \u2691 Use the constraint CHECK (now() AT TIME ZONE timezone IS NOT NULL) . For example: CREATE TABLE locations ( location_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY , name TEXT , timezone TEXT NOT NULL CHECK ( now () AT TIME ZONE timezone IS NOT NULL ) ); Meta \u2691 List databases \u2691 \\l Get column names of a table \u2691 SELECT column_name FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA . COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME = '{table_name}' ; Or, to get the column names along with their type use: \\d+ {table_name} Enable command timing \u2691 \\timing [on|off] stackoverflow Stop/kill process \u2691 First locate the process pid with SELECT pid , query FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active' ; Then, stop or kill the process with SELECT pg_cancel_backend({pid}) or pg_termiante_backend({pid}) respectively. Configuration \u2691 You can use PGTune to calculate configuration for PostgreSQL based on the maximum performance for a given hardware configuration. Parallelization \u2691 To tune the number of workers edit postgresql.conf and in the - Asynchronous Behavior - section edit max_worker_processes , max_parallel_workers_per_gather and max_parallel_workers . Administration \u2691 Change user password \u2691 ALTER USER user_name WITH PASSWORD 'new_password' ; Tips \u2691 Copy data manually between different databases \u2691 If you want to copy just a few rows between tables in different databases and even slightly different schema, you can use the following commands: COPY ( SELECT * FROM user WHERE id = 42 ) TO STDOUT WITH ( FORMAT CSV , HEADER ); Which returns: id,name,created_at,updated_at 42,Some User,2022-03-01 06:18:53.37+00,2022-03-01 06:18:53.37+00 Then, in the other database: COPY user FROM STDIN WITH ( FORMAT CSV , HEADER ); Paste the result from the first query and press Ctrl+D . Stop remote connections \u2691 Some operations, like dropping a database, require that the database has no connections. To stop all remote connections and prevent them from connecting again, do: ALTER DATABASE somedatabase ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = OFF ; SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'somedatabase'; But if you are using PostgreSQL 13 or above, for dropping a table you can directly do: DROP DATABASE db_name WITH ( FORCE ); Performance optimization \u2691 Get the 20 slowest queries \u2691 SELECT substring ( query , 1 , 50 ) AS short_query , round ( total_time :: numeric , 2 ) AS total_time , calls , round ( mean_time :: numeric , 2 ) AS mean , round (( 100 * total_time / sum ( total_time :: numeric ) OVER ()) :: numeric , 2 ) AS percentage_cpu FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY total_time DESC LIMIT 20 ; Reference \u2691 Data types \u2691 Numeric Types", "title": "PostgreSQL"}, {"location": "computer_science/gnu_linux/postgresql/#postgresql", "text": "", "title": "PostgreSQL"}, {"location": "computer_science/gnu_linux/postgresql/#usage", "text": "Use psql .

Example ( main.py ): from typing import Optional from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI () @app . get ( \"/\" ) def read_root (): return { \"Hello\" : \"World\" } @app . get ( \"/items/ {item_id} \" ) def read_item ( item_id : int , q : Optional [ str ] = None ): return { \"item_id\" : item_id , \"q\" : q } Run it with uvicorn main:app --reload and then open your browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/items/5?q=somequery . Usage \u2691 There are two main ways of using this module, with the decorator @app.get(\"{{route}}\") or with FastAPI().add_route(\"{{route}}\", {{function}}) . The first alternative is by far the most common, but if you want to separate the functions from the HTTP API entrypoint, you have to use the second option. For example: from fastapi import FastAPI api = FastAPI() def hello(name: str) -> str: return \"Hello \" + name + \"!\" api.add_route('/hello', hello) The advantage of this alternative is that we can import the function from another module. If you need to change the default value of some argument of the original function, you can use functools . This might be necessary if an argument is a list, since you'll need to set its default value to Query() you can change it with functools instead of modifying the original function (which would be pretty ugly). Make sure of copying the original docstring. Nevertheless, this approach has some caveats such as not handling exceptions raised from the imported function. The best solution for this appears to be defining a wrapper function that handles the arguments, calls the imported function or method and handles the exceptions raising the proper HTTPException . Dependency injection \u2691 A FastAPI decorated function can import the necessary arguments for other functions or objects. For example: from typing import Optional from fastapi import Depends , FastAPI app = FastAPI () async def common_parameters ( q : Optional [ str ] = None , skip : int = 0 , limit : int = 100 ): return { \"q\" : q , \"skip\" : skip , \"limit\" : limit } @app . get ( \"/items/\" ) async def read_items ( commons : dict = Depends ( common_parameters )): return commons In this example, the function read_items will get the parameters for the function common_parameters (i.e., q , skip , limit ) allowing the optional ones to be set or not. Then, the passed parameters will be passed as a dictionary as the commons argument value of read_itmes . This is thanks to Depends . Depends can also be used with classes, and we could get an instance of a class directly to our function. For example by setting the argument: car: Car = Depends(Car) or car: Car = Depends() (which assumes that it depends on the class defined in the type hint).

For example: from fastapi import FastAPI api = FastAPI() def hello(name: str) -> str: return \"Hello \" + name + \"!\" api.add_route('/hello', hello) The advantage of this alternative is that we can import the function from another module. If you need to change the default value of some argument of the original function, you can use functools . This might be necessary if an argument is a list, since you'll need to set its default value to Query() you can change it with functools instead of modifying the original function (which would be pretty ugly). Make sure of copying the original docstring. Nevertheless, this approach has some caveats such as not handling exceptions raised from the imported function.

Strings, bytes or floats will be coerced to ints if possible; otherwise an exception will be raised. name is inferred as a string from the provided default; because it has a default, it is not required. signup_ts is a datetime field which is not required (and takes the value Nonei if it's not supplied). pydantic will process either a unix timestamp int (e.g. 1496498400) or a string representing the date & time. friends uses python's typing system, and requires a list of integers. As with id , integer-like objects will be converted to integers. If validation fails pydantic will raise an error with a breakdown of what was wrong. Validators \u2691 Custom validation and complex relationships between objects can be achieved using the validator decorator. Example: from pydantic import BaseModel , validator class UserModel ( BaseModel ): name : str username : str password1 : str password2 : str @validator ( 'name' ) def name_must_contain_space ( cls , v ): if ' ' not in v : raise ValueError ( 'must contain a space' ) return v . title () The validation function will get the variable name value and can perform checks or transformations to it. It should finally return the desired value for the variable. You can use validators to set the value of an attribute as a combination of others if undefined: from typing import Optional from pydantic import BaseModel , validator class UserModel ( BaseModel ): name : str password1 : str password2 : str username : Optional [ str ] = None accepted_tos : bool = False @validator ( 'username' , pre = True , always = True ) def default_username ( cls , v , values ): if v is None : v = values [ 'name' ] return v always=True is required in this example since otherwise when username is not passed, the validator won't be executed. pre=True makes it run before any other validator so that username is defined in before other possible validations. Note that values only contains the class attributes defined before the one that is being validated. In the example above, values in the default_username validator won't contain the accepted_tos key. Root validators \u2691 Validation can also be performed on the entire model's data. You can decorate a function with @root_validator and it will get all of the values as an argument. This function should process them and raise an exception or return the desired values dictionary. For example: @root_validator def check_passwords_match ( cls , values ): pw1 , pw2 = values . get ( 'password1' ), values . get ( 'password2' ) if pw1 is not None and pw2 is not None and pw1 != pw2 : raise ValueError ( 'passwords do not match' ) return values root_validator takes pre as argument but not always , since its executed always anyways. Note : there is a bug ( #1895 ) that prevents subclasses to override the root_validator method defined in the parent class. A workaround for BaseModel subclasses is described in the issue comments but not for pydantic dataclasses.

You can get it with a work permit or with some short-term visas, such as the touristic visa. This short-term visa will be given for a year at most. Note that you are not allowed to work with the touristic visa. Residence permit steps \u2691 This is the procedure to obtain a residence permit through a touristic visa from Turkey (not from abroad). Since a rental contract and other documents are required, it might be hard to arrange everything from abroad, but it's still possible. It is assumed that you are already in Turkey because you entered with the 90 day touristic visa. Get 4 biometric photos. Get a health insurance. You'll need the original stamped/sealed insurance policy. A minimum-coverage local health insurance policy will cost around 600 TL for a year. Fill the form for the immigration services appointment a Directorate General of Migration Management . Notes: Official required documents list . If the income is your savings, it's recommended to divide your saving by the number of months you are staying and fill the result as your monthly income, instead of puting just 0. video showing the form filling process. Get a photocopy of your passport including the personal information page and the page where the passport control stamp is. Get a statement on having sufficient financial means through the stay. Might not be requested. Could be bank statement of a long enough period. You can open an account in a Turkish bank, for that you will need to get your tax number (vergi numaras\u0131) from the local tax office. Get a notarized copy of your rental agreement. Wait for the appointment. A short interview will take place. If everything goes well, they will tell you to pay the residence permit fees (card and single entry fee) which add up to around 568 TL. Then you have to pay them and come back. The residence permit card will be delivered to your address of stay. Experience \u2691 I applied for the residence permit for touristic purposes for a year. I am a European citizen and this was my first application. I entered Turkey with my passport (visa exemption) on the 10/07/2021. Process \u2691 14/07/2021: Submitted the online form ( https://e-ikamet.goc.gov.tr/ ). For which I needed a house rent contract (they don't ask for it directly but they ask for the house address), a Turkish phone number, a portrait picture and a health insurance policy. 16/07/2021: I received an email informing me of the interview appointment date (05/08/2021 at 13:00). 05/08/2021: I went to the Ankara Valili\u011fi il G\u00f6\u00e7 \u0130daresi M\u00fcd\u00fcrl\u00fc\u011f\u00fc (Barbaros, Binnaz Sk. No:2, 06680 \u00c7ankaya/Ankara) and arrived there at 12:30 (half an hour early). I waited in line and told the security guy that I was early and asked if I could go in anyways. The security guy answered laughing that we all had the appointment at the same time (hundreds of people) so it was ok to go early. He then asked for my pink classifier (pembe dosya) which I had never heard of. Apparently you need to bring your documents in one of those but that rule is not written anywhere. I went down the street and bought one for 3 TL and came back, they let me in without having to wait in the line again. In the reception, some workers where checking the passports and the documents and giving some stickers with a line number. Then, we went to a waiting room where there was a screen calling line numbers. At first you shouldn't wait for your number to be called but instead fill the papers with your phone number and name which are on a table in the back. Then, you should go to the cash desk (vezne) and pay the taxes stated in the printout of the online form. The cash desk opens at one and there is no order to pay. You can only pay with cash. After this, I left that room and went upstairs where I waited for an hour to be called. I waited for my turn for the interview, where I was asked for the basic documents and had no questioning or anything like that and took around 2 minutes. I had to give the notarized copy of my rental contract, the signed form printout, 4 biometric pictures, a photocopy of my passport main page and of the page where the entry stamp was and the health insurance signed policy documents. They didn't ask for the bank statement or anything else. The whole process took 2 hours. It was really messy and people did not generally respect the line order, but the workers were generally friendly and nice. 24/08/2021: I check for the status of my application online ( https://e-ikamet.goc.gov.tr/ ) and saw that there were missing documents (didn't specify which). So I went that same day to the G\u00f6\u00e7 \u0130daresi. A worker checked the status on the computer and told me that I had to pay for the single entry visa fee. I did it and then went upstairs to the missing document issues room, where some workers looked for my folder and added the tax receipt. 03/09/2021: I checked the status of my application and it said that it had been concluded positively. 04/09/2021: I received the residence permit card at my house from PTT. I didn't get any notifications via SMS at all so its important to constantly check online for the status. I asked for the residence permit to be from 01/08/2021 to the 01/08/2022 (same as the insurance) but I got it 14/07/2021 to the 09/07/2022. Costs \u2691 Biometric pictures: 35 TL. One year basic health insurance (SOMPO SIGORTA): 85 TL. Notarized copy of the rent contract: 125 TL. Pink classifier: 3 TL. Card and residence permit taxes: 462 TL. Single entry visa: 759 TL. TOTAL : 1,469 TL I'm not including the Sim card costs (600TL for 3 months with internet) and the photocopy prices (few TL). Things to do after obtaining the residence permit \u2691 Notify my Turkish cell phone operator (updated my details from the app). Otherwise your line will be canceled after some months (source: the guy at Turkcell store). Get access to e-devlet to do bureaucracy online. Go to PTT and ask for the code, you will receive it as an SMS to your Turkish phone number. The cost is 2 TL. Go back to the G\u00f6\u00e7 \u0130daresi to register your address (yes, again). You will need to bring some utility bill registered to your name. You can also go with the person you live with if the bills are under their name and they are already registered (n\u00fcfus) at that address. If they are not registered, they can try to do it from e-devlet or go to the population directorate (n\u00fcfus m\u00fcd\u00fcrl\u00fc\u011f\u00fc).

Abstract \u2691 Economies grow by upgrading the products they produce and export. The technology, capital, institutions, and skills needed to make newer products are more easily adapted from some products than from others. Here, we study this network of relatedness between products, or \u201cproduct space,\u201d finding that more-sophisticated products are located in a densely connected core whereas less-sophisticated products occupy a less-connected periphery. Empirically, countries move through the product space by developing goods close to those they currently produce. Most countries can reach the core only by traversing empirically infrequent distances, which may help explain why poor countries have trouble developing more competitive exports and fail to converge to the income levels of rich countries. Summary \u2691 Economic power is usually measured with the aggregate output of a countries capital and labor. The main idea of the article is that diversity of a countries exports matters, and it's useful when predicting a countries development. Countries are more likely to produce products which have similar requirements as the ones they already produce. This video is a great introduction (and even summary) of what's developed in the paper.

What entitles the state to behave in this manner? And why should citizens obey its commands? This book examines theories of political authority, from the social contract theory, to theories of democratic authorization, to fairness- and consequence-based theories. Ultimately, no theory of authority succeeds, and thus no government has the kind of authority often ascribed to governments. The author goes on to discuss how voluntary and competitive institutions could provide the central goods for the sake of which the state is often deemed necessary, including law, protection from private criminals, and national security. An orderly and livable society thus does not require acquiescence in the illusion of political authority. Quotes \u2691 This book addresses the foundational problem of political philosophy: the problem of accounting for the authority of government. Nearly all political discourse centers on what sort of policies the government should make, and nearly all of it \u2013 whether in political philosophy or in popular forums \u2013 presupposes that the government has a special kind of authority to issue commands to the rest of society. When we argue about what the government\u2019s immigration policy ought to be, for example, we normally presuppose that the state has the right to control movement into and out of the country. When we argue about the best tax policy, we presuppose that the state has the right to take wealth from individuals. When we argue about health care reform, we presuppose that the state has the right to decide how health care should be provided and paid for. Let us begin with a short political story. You live in a small village with a crime problem. Vandals roam the village, stealing and destroying people\u2019s property. No one seems to be doing anything about it. So one day, you and your family decide to put a stop to it. You take your guns and go looking for vandals. Periodically, you catch one, take him back to your house at gunpoint, and lock him in the basement. You provide the prisoners with food so they don\u2019t starve, but you plan to keep them locked in the basement for a few years to teach them a lesson. After operating in this way for a few weeks, you decide to make the rounds of the neighborhood, starting with your next door neighbor. As he answers the door, you ask, \u2018Have you noticed the reduction in crime in the last few weeks?\u2019 He nods. \u2018Well, that is thanks to me.\u2019 You explain your anticrime program. Noting the wary look on your neighbor\u2019s face, you continue. \u2018Anyway, I\u2019m here because it\u2019s time to collect your contribution to the crime prevention fund. Your bill for the month is $100.\u2019 As your neighbor stares at you, making no apparent move to hand over the money, you patiently explain that, should he refuse to make the required payment, you will unfortunately have to label him a criminal, at which point he will be subject to long-term confinement in your basement, along with the aforementioned vandals.

Those who refused to pay would more likely be praised than condemned for standing up to you. Second, most would consider your actions outrageous. Your demands for payment would be condemned as naked extortion, and your confinement of those who refused to pay as kidnapping. The very outrageousness of your conduct, combined with your deluded presumption that the rest of the village would recognize an obligation to support you, would cause many to question your sanity. What does this story have to do with political philosophy? In the story, you behaved like a rudimentary government. Though you did not take on all the functions of a typical, modern state, you assumed two of its most central roles: you punished people who violated others\u2019 rights or disobeyed your commands, and you collected nonvoluntary contributions to finance your activities. Governments are considered ethically permitted to do things that no nongovernmental person or organization may do. Why do we accord this special moral status to government, and are we justified in so doing? This is the problem of political authority. Political authority (hereafter, just \u2018authority\u2019) is the hypothesized moral property in virtue of which governments may coerce people in certain ways not permitted to anyone else and in virtue of which citizens must obey governments in situations in which they would not be obligated to obey anyone else. For example, the law prohibits murder, and we have a moral duty not to murder. But this does not suffice to establish that we have \u2018political obligations\u2019, because we would be morally obligated not to murder even if there were no law against it. But there are other cases in which, according to popular opinion, we are obligated to do things precisely because the law commands them, and we would not be obligated to do those things if they were not legally required. At the end of the chain must come a threat that the violator literally cannot defy. The system as a whole must be anchored by a nonvoluntary intervention, a harm that the state can impose regardless of the individual\u2019s choices. That anchor is provided by physical force. Even the threat of imprisonment requires enforcement: how can the state ensure that the criminal goes to the prison? The answer lies in coercion, involving actual or threatened bodily injury or, at a minimum, physical pushing or pulling of the individual\u2019s body to the location of imprisonment. On the other hand, many possible reasons for coercion are clearly inadequate. If you have a friend who eats too many potato chips, you may try to convince him to give them up. But if he won\u2019t listen, you may not force him to stop. If you admire your neighbor\u2019s car, you may offer to buy it from him. But if he won\u2019t sell, you may not threaten him with violence. Suppose you announce that you believe a neighboring town is building some very destructive weapons, weapons they might one day use to terrorize other villages. To prevent this from happening, you round up a few like-minded villagers and travel to the neighboring town, where you violently depose the mayor, blowing up some buildings and predictably killing several innocent people in the process. If you behaved in this way, you would be labeled a terrorist and murderer, and calls for your execution or life imprisonment would likely abound. But when the government behaves in this way, its behavior is labeled \u2018war\u2019, and many support it. Suppose now that, amidst all your other unusual activities, you decide to start supporting charity. You find a charity that helps the poor. Unfortunately, you believe your village has not contributed enough to this charity voluntarily, so you take to forcibly extracting money from your neighbors and handing it over to the charity. if citizens have agreed to pay the government for its services and have agreed to be subjected to coercion if they fail to pay, then it is permissible for the government to force its citizens to pay. A third form of implicit consent is what I call \u2018consent through presence\u2019, whereby one indicates agreement to a proposal merely by remaining in some location. Similarly, if one calls the police to ask for assistance or protection, if one takes another person to court, if one voluntarily sends one\u2019s children to public schools, or if one takes advantage of government social welfare programs, then one is voluntarily accepting governmental benefits. It can then be argued that one implicitly accepts the conditions known to be attached to the having of a government \u2013 that one should help pay the monetary costs of government and obey the laws of the government. Not necessarily. For example one could just want to recover part of what was stolen from them. 1. Valid consent requires a reasonable way of opting out. All parties to any agreement must have the option to reject the agreement without sacrificing anything to which they have a right. 2. Explicit dissent trumps alleged implicit consent. A valid implicit agreement does not exist if one explicitly states that one does not agree. I announce that anyone who remains at my party must agree to help clean up. Suppose that after my announcement, you reply, \u2018I do not agree.\u2019 I then ask you to leave, but you refuse and instead remain until the end of the party. Are you then obligated to help clean up? You did not agree to clean up, since you explicitly stated that you did not agree (how much clearer could you have been?). Nevertheless, it is plausible that you are obligated to help clean up \u2013 not because you agreed to do so, but because I have the right to set conditions on the use of my house, including the condition that those who use it help clean it. This derives not from an agreement but from my property right over the house. 3. An action can be taken as indicating agreement to some scheme, only if one can be assumed to believe that, if one did not take that action, the scheme would not be imposed upon one. 4. Contractual obligation is mutual and conditional. A contract normally places both parties under an obligation to each other, and one party\u2019s rejection of his contractual obligation releases the other party from her obligation. 2.5.1 The difficulty of opting out Begin with the first condition on valid agreements: all parties to a contract must have a reasonable way of opting out. What are the available means of opting out of the social contract? There is only one: one must vacate the territory controlled by the state. To leave one\u2019s country, one must generally secure the permission of some other state to enter its territory, and most states impose restrictions on immigration. In addition, some individuals lack the financial resources to move to the country of their choice. Those who can move may fail to do so due to attachments to family, friends, and home. Finally, if one moves to another country, one will merely become subject to another government. We may as well assert that a man, by remaining in a vessel, freely consents to the dominion of the master; though he was carried on board while asleep, and must leap into the ocean, and perish, the moment he leaves her. how can someone be required to give up home and job and leave all friends and family behind to express disagreement with a contract? Here is one answer: perhaps the state owns all the territory over which it claims jurisdiction. For illustration, consider the case of the United States. In this case, the state\u2019s control over \u2018its\u2019 territory derives from (1) the earlier expropriation of that land by European colonists from the people who originally occupied it and (2) the state\u2019s present coercive power over the individual landowners who received title to portions of that territory, handed down through the generations from the original expropriators. This does not seem to give rise to a legitimate property right on the part of the U.S. government.12 Even if we overlook source (1), source (2), which applies to all governments, is not a legitimate basis for a property claim. I conclude that the first condition on valid contracts is violated by the social contract. The failure to recognize explicit dissent The absence of mutual obligation The state, in turn, is supposed to assume an obligation to the citizen, to enforce the citizen\u2019s rights, including protecting the citizen from criminals and hostile foreign governments. Does the state ever fail in this duty? What happens when it does? individual has no duty to the state under that contract. If the contract somehow holds only between the state and the public at large, then perhaps \u2018the public at large\u2019 owes something to the state, but no individual does. If the contract somehow holds only between the state and the public at large, then perhaps \u2018the public at large\u2019 owes something to the state, but no individual does. Perhaps you would have accepted the social contract if you had been given a choice. But you were not. This makes your relationship with the government a nonvoluntary, noncontractual one, regardless of whether you are actually happy with the relationship. However, there are circumstances under which hypothetical consent is morally efficacious, circumstances in which the fact that someone \u2018would have agreed\u2019 to some procedure can render it permissible to perform the procedure, where the procedure is of a type that normally requires consent. Suppose that an unconscious patient has been brought to a hospital, in need of surgery to save his life. Under ordinary circumstances, physicians must obtain the patient\u2019s informed consent before operating. In this situation, insistence on this principle would preclude the application of lifesaving medical care, as the patient is unable to either consent to or dissent from the treatment. In such a case, it is generally acknowledged that the doctors should proceed despite the lack of consent. The most natural explanation appeals to the reasonable belief that the patient would consent to the lifesaving procedure if he were able to do so. Once we recognize the unfeasibility of achieving unanimous consent to any nontrivial social arrangement, we might turn instead to majority consent. Can the agreement only of a majority of society\u2019s members \u2013 whether broad agreement to have a government or agreement to have specific policies or personnel \u2013 confer authority on government? For example, is it ethically permissible to release air pollution, say from one\u2019s automobile, or does this violate the rights of those who will inhale the pollutants? It is plausible that one may release certain levels and kinds of pollution but not excessive or excessively toxic pollution. But exactly how much pollution may one release and of what kinds? It is not credible that the natural principles of justice determine unique answers to all questions of this kind nor, if they do, that individuals can reliably apprehend these answers by reflection. I claim that one may break the law when what the law commands is not independently morally required and no serious negative consequences will result. would be bad if generally practiced. But in other cases, the principle seems absurd. Suppose I decide to become a professional philosopher. This seems permissible. But what if everybody did this? Everyone would philosophize all day, and we would all starve. In the United States, it is illegal to provide legal advice to people without admission to the bar (even if you explicitly inform your advisees that you have not been admitted and they want your advice anyway). It is illegal to buy an hour of labor for less than $7.25. Or to buy sex for any amount of money. Or to sell packaged food without listing the number of calories it contains on the package. Or to run a private company that delivers mail to individuals\u2019 mailboxes. It is illegal to sell stevia as a food additive, though legal to sell it as a \u2018dietary supplement\u2019. And so on. The state has the right, at most, to coercively impose correct and just policies to prevent very serious harms.24 No one has the right to coercively enforce counterproductive or useless policies nor to enforce policies aimed at goals of lesser import. The state may be entitled to collect taxes, to administer a system of police and courts to protect society from individual rights violators, and to provide military defense. In doing so, the state and its agents may take only the minimal funds and employ only the minimal coercion necessary. The state may not go on to coercively impose paternalistic or moralistic laws, policies motivated by rent seeking, or policies aimed at promoting unnecessary goods, such as support for the arts or a space program. Sam is opposed to cigarette smoking due to its severe health harms. Not content merely to avoid cigarettes himself, he issues a proclamation to his community that no one may smoke. After the proclamation, Sam catches you smoking, kidnaps you at gunpoint, and locks you in his basement. You share the basement with thieves, rapists, and murderers for the next year, until you are released. The person who sold you the cigarettes is locked in the basement for the next six years. 7.1.3 Rent seeking Rent seeking is behavior designed to extract wealth from others, especially through the vehicle of the state, without providing compensatory benefits in return. Rent seeking is behavior designed to extract wealth from others, especially through the vehicle of the state, without providing compensatory benefits in return. \u2013 Prescription drug laws. These laws transfer money from consumers to doctors and pharmacists. If a person wishes to buy a prescription drug, he must first pay a doctor to see him and give him permission to buy it. \u2013 Subsidies for college education. These increase the demand for college education far above the market level and thereby transfer resources to colleges and universities. (The author is grateful for the funds that you have provided him.) Archer asks Sam for some financial assistance, so Sam goes out, mugs some people, and gives the money to Archer. 7.1.4 Immigration Marvin is in need of food, without which he will suffer from malnutrition or starvation.8 He plans to travel to a nearby marketplace, where he will be able to trade for food. But before he can reach the marketplace, he is accosted by Sam, who does not want Marvin to trade in the marketplace, Therefore, redistribution of wealth from high- to low-income persons will reduce a society\u2019s total investment rate in favor of near-term consumption. This will reduce a society\u2019s rate of economic growth. The American poor, for example, are only poor relative to other Americans; Some would object that if all police officers took my arguments to heart, then all would either quit or get themselves fired, which would be much worse for society than having police who enforce both just and unjust laws. But surely, long before all police officers had resigned or been fired, the government would accede to the need for reform and repeal the unjust laws that were causing it to lose its police force, or at least allow the police to refrain from enforcing those laws. A soldier should likewise refuse to fight in an unjust war. The direct use of physical force is so poor a solution to the problem of limited resources that it is commonly employed only by small children and great nations. In the absence of government, protection agencies would arise for the same reason that most businesses arise in a free market; namely, that there is a need which people are willing to pay to have satisfied. One important kind of dispute occurs when a person is accused of a crime which he denies committing. Another type occurs when people disagree over whether a particular type of conduct ought to be tolerated; for instance, I may think my neighbor is playing his music too loud, while he thinks the volume is just fine. A third type concerns the terms of business relationships, including disputes about the interpretation of contracts. violent conflict tends to be very dangerous for both parties; Business managers, however, are considerably more uniform than the general population. They tend to share two traits in particular: a strong desire to generate profits for their businesses, and a reasonable awareness of the effective means of doing so. Employees of a security agency have their own individual wills, distinct from the goals of the agency. If management decided to attack another agency solely to put a competitor out of business, widespread desertion is the most probable result. There are two reasons for this. First, most human beings are opposed to undertaking very large risks to their own lives for the sake of maximizing profits for their boss. ii) Due to their monopolistic positions, governments can afford to make extremely large and costly errors without fear of being supplanted. But why should there not be agencies devoted to protecting criminals from their victims\u2019 attempts to secure justice? What asymmetry between criminals and peaceful cooperators makes it more feasible, profitable, or otherwise attractive for an agency to protect ordinary people than to protect criminals? 10.4.1 The profitability of enforcing rights There are at least three important asymmetries that favor the protection of noncriminal persons over criminals. First, far more people wish to be protected against crime than wish to be protected in committing crimes. Almost no one desires to be a crime victim, while only a few desire to be criminals. Second, the harms suffered by victims of crime are typically far greater than the benefits enjoyed by those who commit crimes. Ordinary people would therefore be willing to pay more to avoid being victimized than criminals would be willing to pay for the chance to victimize others. In virtue of these first two conditions, there is far more money to be made in the business of protection against criminals than in the business of protection for criminals. Given that the two \u2018products\u2019 exclude each other \u2013 if one product is effectively supplied in the marketplace, then the other necessarily is not \u2013 it is the less profitable one that will fail to be supplied. If a rogue protection agency decides to buck the trend by supporting criminals, it will find itself locked in perpetual and hopeless conflict with far more profitable and numerous protection agencies financed by noncriminal customers. The third asymmetry is that criminals choose to commit crimes, whereas crime victims do not choose to be victimized. Criminals, in other words, intentionally engage in behavior guaranteed to bring them into conflict with others. From the standpoint of a protection agency, this is an unattractive feature in a client, since the more conflicts there are in which the agency is called upon to protect clients, the higher the agency\u2019s costs will be. Offering protection for criminals is analogous to offering fire insurance for arsonists. 10.4.1 The profitability of enforcing rights There are at least three important asymmetries that favor the protection of noncriminal persons over criminals.

Given that the two \u2018products\u2019 exclude each other \u2013 if one product is effectively supplied in the marketplace, then the other necessarily is not \u2013 it is the less profitable one that will fail to be supplied. If a rogue protection agency decides to buck the trend by supporting criminals, it will find itself locked in perpetual and hopeless conflict with far more profitable and numerous protection agencies financed by noncriminal customers. The third asymmetry is that criminals choose to commit crimes, whereas crime victims do not choose to be victimized. Criminals, in other words, intentionally engage in behavior guaranteed to bring them into conflict with others. From the standpoint of a protection agency, this is an unattractive feature in a client, since the more conflicts there are in which the agency is called upon to protect clients, the higher the agency\u2019s costs will be. are there forces that prevent a government from acting to protect criminals? during the slavery era, government protected slave owners from their slaves rather than the other way around. democratic governments function as tools for special-interest groups to steal from the rest of society. no one should have to pay for justice. But what the objection points to is, not a flaw in the anarcho-capitalist system, but a flaw in human nature, for the necessity of paying for justice is created, not by the anarcho-capitalist system, but simply by the fact that criminals exist, and that fact has its roots in the perennial infirmities of human nature. In a government-dominated system, people must pay for justice, just as surely as in an anarchist system. It is not as though courts and police forces can somehow operate without cost if only they are monopolistic and coercive. 10.6.1 Do businesses serve the poor? Unfortunately, there are no actual societies with a free market in security. We can, however, examine societies with relatively free markets in a variety of other goods and services. In such societies, for how many of these other goods and services is it true that suppliers cater solely to the rich, providing no products suitable for middle- and lower-income customers? Is clothing manufactured solely for the wealthy, leaving the poor to wander the streets naked? Do supermarkets stock only caviar and Dom P\u00e9rignon? Which chain is larger: Walmart or Bloomingdale\u2019s? Admittedly, there are some products, such as yachts and Learjets, that have yet to appear in affordable models for the average consumer, yet the overwhelming majority of industries are dominated by production for lower- and middle-income consumers. The main explanation is volume: for most products, there are many more consumers seeking a cheap product than consumers seeking an expensive product. In one sense, yes: as a result of imperfect protection, some poor people will become victims of crime. This is unjust, in the sense that it is unjust that anyone ever suffers from crime. The injustice inherent in crime, however, points to a flaw in human nature rather than in the anarchist system. Some people will suffer from crime under any feasible social system. The question is whether anarchy faces a greater problem or a greater injustice than governmental systems. 10.6.2 How well does government protect the poor? Even if inequality in the distribution of crime is an independent injustice, this does not obviously favor government over anarchy, since large inequalities in the distribution of crime occur in all state-based societies as well, where the wealthy are much better protected than the poor. According to FBI statistics, only about half of all reported violent crimes and a fifth of reported property crimes are solved by law enforcement agencies On a theoretical level, it is not difficult to understand why government police might be less effective than private protection agencies. If a protection agency provides poor protection or charges excessive fees, it must fear loss of customers to rival agencies. But if the police provide poor protection at a high price, they need have no fear of losing market share or going out of business. A plausible alternative approach would be to attempt to deny organized crime its most important sources of revenue. Criminal organizations are chiefly focused on collecting money, which they do mostly through the provision of illegal goods and services. Thus, a powerful strategy for crippling organized crime would be to legalize drugs, gambling, and prostitution. I do not claim that this would eliminate all organized crime. It would, however, strike a blow to organized crime more devastating than anything the state could hope to do by way of wiretaps, sting operations, and indictments. The vast majority of organized crime\u2019s revenue stream would dry up virtually overnight, forcing most of its members to seek other employment. few people in fact think that a contract to purchase sexual services victimizes any person who merely finds out about it and doesn\u2019t like it, and few are in fact willing to pay as much to prevent other people from engaging in prostitution as prostitutes and their clients are willing to pay to be left alone. 10.9.2 Extortion by government Now consider the analogous problem for governmental systems: why shouldn\u2019t the government extort money from people without protecting them? All governments in fact extort money, though the practice is usually termed \u2018taxation\u2019 rather than \u2018extortion\u2019. Imagine that a private protection agency somehow acquired a monopoly in a large geographical area and began to extract payments from the population by force. Few would contend that, once this state of affairs transpired, prices would drop and service would improve. Surely the opposite would occur. But that is precisely the position of societies with government-based protection. What about the protection industry? The fixed costs for a protection agency are minimal. The business owner must have sufficient funds to hire a few employees and equip them with weapons and tools for enforcement and investigation. All social systems are imperfect. In every society, people sometimes suffer from crime and injustice. In an anarchist society, this would remain true. The test of anarchism as a political ideal is whether it can reduce the quantity of injustice suffered relative to the best alternative system, which I take to be representative democracy. Most of the objections raised against anarchy in fact apply more clearly and forcefully to government. This fact is often overlooked because, when confronted with radical ideas, we tend to look only for objections to the new ideas rather than for objections to the status quo. property owners or local associations of property owners could specify the body of law to govern interactions occurring on their property. Existing government-based criminal justice systems rely on imprisonment of criminals as a response to crime. It is thought that society as a whole benefits from this practice because it keeps criminals off the streets for a time and deters others from entering a life of crime. The victims of a particular crime, however, generally receive nothing in the way of compensation, and the rest of society is forced to pay for criminals\u2019 upkeep during their terms of imprisonment. The anarcho-capitalist justice system would most likely focus on restitution rather than punishment. The victim of a crime is justly entitled to collect full compensation for the crime; that is, sufficient compensation to return him to the welfare level he would have enjoyed if the crime had not occurred. But what if a particular court regularly awarded excess compensation \u2013 say, twice what the victim was justly entitled to and twice what other courts generally awarded for a given crime? Wouldn\u2019t the excess compensation court be favored by victims? And since almost everyone considers himself more likely to become a crime victim than to become a criminal, almost everyone would want any future disputes of theirs to be resolved by such a court. These excessive awards would create powerful deterrents to crime, resulting in a dramatic drop in the crime rate. While this may sound like a happy result, it would put increasing financial pressure on arbitration firms. As the crime rate dropped, arbitration firms would continue to raise their compensation awards in the effort to collect a larger share of the dwindling market. unduly tainting their reputation for integrity. I therefore think it plausible that in an anarcho-capitalist society, criminals would often suffer somewhat more than they deserved. This is a possible problem with the system, but it is not a terrible problem. As an exercise, try to imagine an ideal legal system. Before reading on, try to estimate how many pages worth of laws that system would contain. There are many difficulties with making such an estimate; nevertheless, attempting at least a vague, order-of-magnitude estimate before finding out how much law actually exists may help to forestall the tendency to rationalize the status quo. In 2009, the average American law firm billed $284 per hour, with a typical divorce costing between $15,000 and $30,000. To the average American, with an annual income of $39,000, any use of the government\u2019s justice system represents an overwhelming financial burden.18 Why are legal services so expensive? One reason is the oversupply of law mentioned above. The complexity, technicality, and sheer length of the laws and legal procedures forces individuals to pay experts to handle any legal procedure, and it forces those experts to expend a great deal of labor on each case. Another reason can be found in the restrictions on the supply of legal services, which by law may only be purchased from government-approved sources (lawyers who have been admitted to the bar, generally after a lengthy and very expensive law school education). it seems unlikely that an anarchic society could maintain anything like the military forces typical of modern governments. For these reasons, members of an anarchic society could not hope to defeat a governmental army in open combat, nor could they hope, as governments often do, it seems unlikely that an anarchic society could maintain anything like the military forces typical of modern governments. For these reasons, members of an anarchic society could not hope to defeat a governmental army in open combat, nor could they hope, as governments often do, to wage an aggressive war against another country. territory In one respect, conquering an anarchic society would be more difficult than conquering a nation-state.

You live in a small village with a crime problem. Vandals roam the village, stealing and destroying people\u2019s property. No one seems to be doing anything about it.

Those who refused to pay would more likely be praised than condemned for standing up to you. Second, most would consider your actions outrageous. Your demands for payment would be condemned as naked extortion, and your confinement of those who refused to pay as kidnapping. The very outrageousness of your conduct, combined with your deluded presumption that the rest of the village would recognize an obligation to support you, would cause many to question your sanity. What does this story have to do with political philosophy? In the story, you behaved like a rudimentary government. Though you did not take on all the functions of a typical, modern state, you assumed two of its most central roles: you punished people who violated others\u2019 rights or disobeyed your commands, and you collected nonvoluntary contributions to finance your activities. Governments are considered ethically permitted to do things that no nongovernmental person or organization may do. Why do we accord this special moral status to government, and are we justified in so doing? This is the problem of political authority. Political authority (hereafter, just \u2018authority\u2019) is the hypothesized moral property in virtue of which governments may coerce people in certain ways not permitted to anyone else and in virtue of which citizens must obey governments in situations in which they would not be obligated to obey anyone else. For example, the law prohibits murder, and we have a moral duty not to murder. But this does not suffice to establish that we have \u2018political obligations\u2019, because we would be morally obligated not to murder even if there were no law against it. But there are other cases in which, according to popular opinion, we are obligated to do things precisely because the law commands them, and we would not be obligated to do those things if they were not legally required. At the end of the chain must come a threat that the violator literally cannot defy. The system as a whole must be anchored by a nonvoluntary intervention, a harm that the state can impose regardless of the individual\u2019s choices. That anchor is provided by physical force. Even the threat of imprisonment requires enforcement: how can the state ensure that the criminal goes to the prison? The answer lies in coercion, involving actual or threatened bodily injury or, at a minimum, physical pushing or pulling of the individual\u2019s body to the location of imprisonment. On the other hand, many possible reasons for coercion are clearly inadequate. If you have a friend who eats too many potato chips, you may try to convince him to give them up. But if he won\u2019t listen, you may not force him to stop. If you admire your neighbor\u2019s car, you may offer to buy it from him. But if he won\u2019t sell, you may not threaten him with violence. Suppose you announce that you believe a neighboring town is building some very destructive weapons, weapons they might one day use to terrorize other villages. To prevent this from happening, you round up a few like-minded villagers and travel to the neighboring town, where you violently depose the mayor, blowing up some buildings and predictably killing several innocent people in the process. If you behaved in this way, you would be labeled a terrorist and murderer, and calls for your execution or life imprisonment would likely abound. But when the government behaves in this way, its behavior is labeled \u2018war\u2019, and many support it. Suppose now that, amidst all your other unusual activities, you decide to start supporting charity. You find a charity that helps the poor. Unfortunately, you believe your village has not contributed enough to this charity voluntarily, so you take to forcibly extracting money from your neighbors and handing it over to the charity. if citizens have agreed to pay the government for its services and have agreed to be subjected to coercion if they fail to pay, then it is permissible for the government to force its citizens to pay. A third form of implicit consent is what I call \u2018consent through presence\u2019, whereby one indicates agreement to a proposal merely by remaining in some location. Similarly, if one calls the police to ask for assistance or protection, if one takes another person to court, if one voluntarily sends one\u2019s children to public schools, or if one takes advantage of government social welfare programs, then one is voluntarily accepting governmental benefits. It can then be argued that one implicitly accepts the conditions known to be attached to the having of a government \u2013 that one should help pay the monetary costs of government and obey the laws of the government. Not necessarily. For example one could just want to recover part of what was stolen from them. 1. Valid consent requires a reasonable way of opting out. All parties to any agreement must have the option to reject the agreement without sacrificing anything to which they have a right. 2. Explicit dissent trumps alleged implicit consent. A valid implicit agreement does not exist if one explicitly states that one does not agree. I announce that anyone who remains at my party must agree to help clean up. Suppose that after my announcement, you reply, \u2018I do not agree.\u2019 I then ask you to leave, but you refuse and instead remain until the end of the party. Are you then obligated to help clean up? You did not agree to clean up, since you explicitly stated that you did not agree (how much clearer could you have been?). Nevertheless, it is plausible that you are obligated to help clean up \u2013 not because you agreed to do so, but because I have the right to set conditions on the use of my house, including the condition that those who use it help clean it. This derives not from an agreement but from my property right over the house. 3. An action can be taken as indicating agreement to some scheme, only if one can be assumed to believe that, if one did not take that action, the scheme would not be imposed upon one. 4. Contractual obligation is mutual and conditional. A contract normally places both parties under an obligation to each other, and one party\u2019s rejection of his contractual obligation releases the other party from her obligation. 2.5.1 The difficulty of opting out Begin with the first condition on valid agreements: all parties to a contract must have a reasonable way of opting out. What are the available means of opting out of the social contract? There is only one: one must vacate the territory controlled by the state. To leave one\u2019s country, one must generally secure the permission of some other state to enter its territory, and most states impose restrictions on immigration. In addition, some individuals lack the financial resources to move to the country of their choice. Those who can move may fail to do so due to attachments to family, friends, and home. Finally, if one moves to another country, one will merely become subject to another government. We may as well assert that a man, by remaining in a vessel, freely consents to the dominion of the master; though he was carried on board while asleep, and must leap into the ocean, and perish, the moment he leaves her. how can someone be required to give up home and job and leave all friends and family behind to express disagreement with a contract? Here is one answer: perhaps the state owns all the territory over which it claims jurisdiction. For illustration, consider the case of the United States. In this case, the state\u2019s control over \u2018its\u2019 territory derives from (1) the earlier expropriation of that land by European colonists from the people who originally occupied it and (2) the state\u2019s present coercive power over the individual landowners who received title to portions of that territory, handed down through the generations from the original expropriators. This does not seem to give rise to a legitimate property right on the part of the U.S. government.12 Even if we overlook source (1), source (2), which applies to all governments, is not a legitimate basis for a property claim. I conclude that the first condition on valid contracts is violated by the social contract. The failure to recognize explicit dissent The absence of mutual obligation The state, in turn, is supposed to assume an obligation to the citizen, to enforce the citizen\u2019s rights, including protecting the citizen from criminals and hostile foreign governments. Does the state ever fail in this duty? What happens when it does? individual has no duty to the state under that contract. If the contract somehow holds only between the state and the public at large, then perhaps \u2018the public at large\u2019 owes something to the state, but no individual does. If the contract somehow holds only between the state and the public at large, then perhaps \u2018the public at large\u2019 owes something to the state, but no individual does. Perhaps you would have accepted the social contract if you had been given a choice. But you were not. This makes your relationship with the government a nonvoluntary, noncontractual one, regardless of whether you are actually happy with the relationship. However, there are circumstances under which hypothetical consent is morally efficacious, circumstances in which the fact that someone \u2018would have agreed\u2019 to some procedure can render it permissible to perform the procedure, where the procedure is of a type that normally requires consent. Suppose that an unconscious patient has been brought to a hospital, in need of surgery to save his life. Under ordinary circumstances, physicians must obtain the patient\u2019s informed consent before operating. In this situation, insistence on this principle would preclude the application of lifesaving medical care, as the patient is unable to either consent to or dissent from the treatment. In such a case, it is generally acknowledged that the doctors should proceed despite the lack of consent. The most natural explanation appeals to the reasonable belief that the patient would consent to the lifesaving procedure if he were able to do so. Once we recognize the unfeasibility of achieving unanimous consent to any nontrivial social arrangement, we might turn instead to majority consent. Can the agreement only of a majority of society\u2019s members \u2013 whether broad agreement to have a government or agreement to have specific policies or personnel \u2013 confer authority on government? For example, is it ethically permissible to release air pollution, say from one\u2019s automobile, or does this violate the rights of those who will inhale the pollutants? It is plausible that one may release certain levels and kinds of pollution but not excessive or excessively toxic pollution. But exactly how much pollution may one release and of what kinds? It is not credible that the natural principles of justice determine unique answers to all questions of this kind nor, if they do, that individuals can reliably apprehend these answers by reflection. I claim that one may break the law when what the law commands is not independently morally required and no serious negative consequences will result. would be bad if generally practiced. But in other cases, the principle seems absurd. Suppose I decide to become a professional philosopher. This seems permissible. But what if everybody did this? Everyone would philosophize all day, and we would all starve. In the United States, it is illegal to provide legal advice to people without admission to the bar (even if you explicitly inform your advisees that you have not been admitted and they want your advice anyway). It is illegal to buy an hour of labor for less than $7.25. Or to buy sex for any amount of money. Or to sell packaged food without listing the number of calories it contains on the package. Or to run a private company that delivers mail to individuals\u2019 mailboxes. It is illegal to sell stevia as a food additive, though legal to sell it as a \u2018dietary supplement\u2019. And so on. The state has the right, at most, to coercively impose correct and just policies to prevent very serious harms.24 No one has the right to coercively enforce counterproductive or useless policies nor to enforce policies aimed at goals of lesser import. The state may be entitled to collect taxes, to administer a system of police and courts to protect society from individual rights violators, and to provide military defense. In doing so, the state and its agents may take only the minimal funds and employ only the minimal coercion necessary. The state may not go on to coercively impose paternalistic or moralistic laws, policies motivated by rent seeking, or policies aimed at promoting unnecessary goods, such as support for the arts or a space program. Sam is opposed to cigarette smoking due to its severe health harms. Not content merely to avoid cigarettes himself, he issues a proclamation to his community that no one may smoke. After the proclamation, Sam catches you smoking, kidnaps you at gunpoint, and locks you in his basement. You share the basement with thieves, rapists, and murderers for the next year, until you are released. The person who sold you the cigarettes is locked in the basement for the next six years. 7.1.3 Rent seeking Rent seeking is behavior designed to extract wealth from others, especially through the vehicle of the state, without providing compensatory benefits in return. Rent seeking is behavior designed to extract wealth from others, especially through the vehicle of the state, without providing compensatory benefits in return. \u2013 Prescription drug laws. These laws transfer money from consumers to doctors and pharmacists. If a person wishes to buy a prescription drug, he must first pay a doctor to see him and give him permission to buy it. \u2013 Subsidies for college education. These increase the demand for college education far above the market level and thereby transfer resources to colleges and universities. (The author is grateful for the funds that you have provided him.) Archer asks Sam for some financial assistance, so Sam goes out, mugs some people, and gives the money to Archer. 7.1.4 Immigration Marvin is in need of food, without which he will suffer from malnutrition or starvation.8 He plans to travel to a nearby marketplace, where he will be able to trade for food. But before he can reach the marketplace, he is accosted by Sam, who does not want Marvin to trade in the marketplace, Therefore, redistribution of wealth from high- to low-income persons will reduce a society\u2019s total investment rate in favor of near-term consumption. This will reduce a society\u2019s rate of economic growth. The American poor, for example, are only poor relative to other Americans; Some would object that if all police officers took my arguments to heart, then all would either quit or get themselves fired, which would be much worse for society than having police who enforce both just and unjust laws. But surely, long before all police officers had resigned or been fired, the government would accede to the need for reform and repeal the unjust laws that were causing it to lose its police force, or at least allow the police to refrain from enforcing those laws. A soldier should likewise refuse to fight in an unjust war. The direct use of physical force is so poor a solution to the problem of limited resources that it is commonly employed only by small children and great nations. In the absence of government, protection agencies would arise for the same reason that most businesses arise in a free market; namely, that there is a need which people are willing to pay to have satisfied. One important kind of dispute occurs when a person is accused of a crime which he denies committing. Another type occurs when people disagree over whether a particular type of conduct ought to be tolerated; for instance, I may think my neighbor is playing his music too loud, while he thinks the volume is just fine. A third type concerns the terms of business relationships, including disputes about the interpretation of contracts. violent conflict tends to be very dangerous for both parties; Business managers, however, are considerably more uniform than the general population. They tend to share two traits in particular: a strong desire to generate profits for their businesses, and a reasonable awareness of the effective means of doing so. Employees of a security agency have their own individual wills, distinct from the goals of the agency. If management decided to attack another agency solely to put a competitor out of business, widespread desertion is the most probable result. There are two reasons for this. First, most human beings are opposed to undertaking very large risks to their own lives for the sake of maximizing profits for their boss. ii) Due to their monopolistic positions, governments can afford to make extremely large and costly errors without fear of being supplanted. But why should there not be agencies devoted to protecting criminals from their victims\u2019 attempts to secure justice? What asymmetry between criminals and peaceful cooperators makes it more feasible, profitable, or otherwise attractive for an agency to protect ordinary people than to protect criminals? 10.4.1 The profitability of enforcing rights There are at least three important asymmetries that favor the protection of noncriminal persons over criminals. First, far more people wish to be protected against crime than wish to be protected in committing crimes. Almost no one desires to be a crime victim, while only a few desire to be criminals. Second, the harms suffered by victims of crime are typically far greater than the benefits enjoyed by those who commit crimes. Ordinary people would therefore be willing to pay more to avoid being victimized than criminals would be willing to pay for the chance to victimize others. In virtue of these first two conditions, there is far more money to be made in the business of protection against criminals than in the business of protection for criminals. Given that the two \u2018products\u2019 exclude each other \u2013 if one product is effectively supplied in the marketplace, then the other necessarily is not \u2013 it is the less profitable one that will fail to be supplied. If a rogue protection agency decides to buck the trend by supporting criminals, it will find itself locked in perpetual and hopeless conflict with far more profitable and numerous protection agencies financed by noncriminal customers. The third asymmetry is that criminals choose to commit crimes, whereas crime victims do not choose to be victimized. Criminals, in other words, intentionally engage in behavior guaranteed to bring them into conflict with others. From the standpoint of a protection agency, this is an unattractive feature in a client, since the more conflicts there are in which the agency is called upon to protect clients, the higher the agency\u2019s costs will be. Offering protection for criminals is analogous to offering fire insurance for arsonists. 10.4.1 The profitability of enforcing rights There are at least three important asymmetries that favor the protection of noncriminal persons over criminals. First, far more people wish to be protected against crime than wish to be protected in committing crimes. Almost no one desires to be a crime victim, while only a few desire to be criminals. Second, the harms suffered by victims of crime are typically far greater than the benefits enjoyed by those who commit crimes.

But what the objection points to is, not a flaw in the anarcho-capitalist system, but a flaw in human nature, for the necessity of paying for justice is created, not by the anarcho-capitalist system, but simply by the fact that criminals exist, and that fact has its roots in the perennial infirmities of human nature. In a government-dominated system, people must pay for justice, just as surely as in an anarchist system. It is not as though courts and police forces can somehow operate without cost if only they are monopolistic and coercive. 10.6.1 Do businesses serve the poor? Unfortunately, there are no actual societies with a free market in security. We can, however, examine societies with relatively free markets in a variety of other goods and services. In such societies, for how many of these other goods and services is it true that suppliers cater solely to the rich, providing no products suitable for middle- and lower-income customers? Is clothing manufactured solely for the wealthy, leaving the poor to wander the streets naked? Do supermarkets stock only caviar and Dom P\u00e9rignon? Which chain is larger: Walmart or Bloomingdale\u2019s? Admittedly, there are some products, such as yachts and Learjets, that have yet to appear in affordable models for the average consumer, yet the overwhelming majority of industries are dominated by production for lower- and middle-income consumers. The main explanation is volume: for most products, there are many more consumers seeking a cheap product than consumers seeking an expensive product. In one sense, yes: as a result of imperfect protection, some poor people will become victims of crime. This is unjust, in the sense that it is unjust that anyone ever suffers from crime. The injustice inherent in crime, however, points to a flaw in human nature rather than in the anarchist system. Some people will suffer from crime under any feasible social system. The question is whether anarchy faces a greater problem or a greater injustice than governmental systems. 10.6.2 How well does government protect the poor? Even if inequality in the distribution of crime is an independent injustice, this does not obviously favor government over anarchy, since large inequalities in the distribution of crime occur in all state-based societies as well, where the wealthy are much better protected than the poor. According to FBI statistics, only about half of all reported violent crimes and a fifth of reported property crimes are solved by law enforcement agencies On a theoretical level, it is not difficult to understand why government police might be less effective than private protection agencies. If a protection agency provides poor protection or charges excessive fees, it must fear loss of customers to rival agencies. But if the police provide poor protection at a high price, they need have no fear of losing market share or going out of business. A plausible alternative approach would be to attempt to deny organized crime its most important sources of revenue. Criminal organizations are chiefly focused on collecting money, which they do mostly through the provision of illegal goods and services. Thus, a powerful strategy for crippling organized crime would be to legalize drugs, gambling, and prostitution. I do not claim that this would eliminate all organized crime. It would, however, strike a blow to organized crime more devastating than anything the state could hope to do by way of wiretaps, sting operations, and indictments. The vast majority of organized crime\u2019s revenue stream would dry up virtually overnight, forcing most of its members to seek other employment. few people in fact think that a contract to purchase sexual services victimizes any person who merely finds out about it and doesn\u2019t like it, and few are in fact willing to pay as much to prevent other people from engaging in prostitution as prostitutes and their clients are willing to pay to be left alone. 10.9.2 Extortion by government Now consider the analogous problem for governmental systems: why shouldn\u2019t the government extort money from people without protecting them? All governments in fact extort money, though the practice is usually termed \u2018taxation\u2019 rather than \u2018extortion\u2019. Imagine that a private protection agency somehow acquired a monopoly in a large geographical area and began to extract payments from the population by force. Few would contend that, once this state of affairs transpired, prices would drop and service would improve. Surely the opposite would occur. But that is precisely the position of societies with government-based protection. What about the protection industry? The fixed costs for a protection agency are minimal. The business owner must have sufficient funds to hire a few employees and equip them with weapons and tools for enforcement and investigation. All social systems are imperfect. In every society, people sometimes suffer from crime and injustice. In an anarchist society, this would remain true. The test of anarchism as a political ideal is whether it can reduce the quantity of injustice suffered relative to the best alternative system, which I take to be representative democracy. Most of the objections raised against anarchy in fact apply more clearly and forcefully to government. This fact is often overlooked because, when confronted with radical ideas, we tend to look only for objections to the new ideas rather than for objections to the status quo. property owners or local associations of property owners could specify the body of law to govern interactions occurring on their property. Existing government-based criminal justice systems rely on imprisonment of criminals as a response to crime. It is thought that society as a whole benefits from this practice because it keeps criminals off the streets for a time and deters others from entering a life of crime. The victims of a particular crime, however, generally receive nothing in the way of compensation, and the rest of society is forced to pay for criminals\u2019 upkeep during their terms of imprisonment. The anarcho-capitalist justice system would most likely focus on restitution rather than punishment. The victim of a crime is justly entitled to collect full compensation for the crime; that is, sufficient compensation to return him to the welfare level he would have enjoyed if the crime had not occurred. But what if a particular court regularly awarded excess compensation \u2013 say, twice what the victim was justly entitled to and twice what other courts generally awarded for a given crime? Wouldn\u2019t the excess compensation court be favored by victims? And since almost everyone considers himself more likely to become a crime victim than to become a criminal, almost everyone would want any future disputes of theirs to be resolved by such a court. These excessive awards would create powerful deterrents to crime, resulting in a dramatic drop in the crime rate. While this may sound like a happy result, it would put increasing financial pressure on arbitration firms. As the crime rate dropped, arbitration firms would continue to raise their compensation awards in the effort to collect a larger share of the dwindling market. unduly tainting their reputation for integrity. I therefore think it plausible that in an anarcho-capitalist society, criminals would often suffer somewhat more than they deserved. This is a possible problem with the system, but it is not a terrible problem. As an exercise, try to imagine an ideal legal system. Before reading on, try to estimate how many pages worth of laws that system would contain. There are many difficulties with making such an estimate; nevertheless, attempting at least a vague, order-of-magnitude estimate before finding out how much law actually exists may help to forestall the tendency to rationalize the status quo. In 2009, the average American law firm billed $284 per hour, with a typical divorce costing between $15,000 and $30,000. To the average American, with an annual income of $39,000, any use of the government\u2019s justice system represents an overwhelming financial burden.18 Why are legal services so expensive? One reason is the oversupply of law mentioned above. The complexity, technicality, and sheer length of the laws and legal procedures forces individuals to pay experts to handle any legal procedure, and it forces those experts to expend a great deal of labor on each case. Another reason can be found in the restrictions on the supply of legal services, which by law may only be purchased from government-approved sources (lawyers who have been admitted to the bar, generally after a lengthy and very expensive law school education). it seems unlikely that an anarchic society could maintain anything like the military forces typical of modern governments. For these reasons, members of an anarchic society could not hope to defeat a governmental army in open combat, nor could they hope, as governments often do, it seems unlikely that an anarchic society could maintain anything like the military forces typical of modern governments. For these reasons, members of an anarchic society could not hope to defeat a governmental army in open combat, nor could they hope, as governments often do, to wage an aggressive war against another country. territory In one respect, conquering an anarchic society would be more difficult than conquering a nation-state. In one respect, conquering an anarchic society would be more difficult than conquering a nation-state. Some national governments are already in a position to drastically reduce their militaries without fear of endangering national security. The United States, for example, could cut its military budget by 83 percent and still remain the largest military spender in the world.", "title": "Quotes"}, {"location": "projects/projects/", "tags": ["projects"], "text": "Finished projects \u2691 m0wer/fuzzy_showers : Modeling of a dynamic system using fuzzy logic.
